Abstract
Recent advancements in spoken dialogue models, exemplified by systems like
GPT-4o, have captured significant attention in the speech domain. In the broader
context of multimodal models, the speech modality offers a direct interface for
human-computer interaction, enabling direct communication between AI and users.
Compared to traditional three-tier cascaded spoken dialogue models that comprise
speech recognition (ASR), large language models (LLMs), and text-to-speech
(TTS), modern spoken dialogue models exhibit greater intelligence. These ad-
vanced spoken dialogue models not only comprehend audio, music, and other
speech-related features, but also capture stylistic and timbral characteristics in
speech. Moreover, they erate high-quality, multi-turn speech responses with low
latency, enabling real-time interaction through simultaneous listening and speaking
capability. Despite the progress in spoken dialogue systems, there is a lack of
comprehensive surveys that systematically organize and analyze these systems and
the underlying technologies. To address this, we have first compiled existing
spoken dialogue systems in the chronological order and categorized them
into the cascaded and end-to-end paradigms. We then provide an in-depth
overview of the core technologies in spoken dialogue models, covering aspects
such as speech representation, training paradigm, streaming, duplex, and
interaction capabilities. Each section discusses the limitations of these technolo-
gies and outlines considerations for future research. Additionally, we present a
thorough review of relevant datasets, evaluation metrics, and benchmarks from
the perspectives of training and evaluating spoken dialogue systems. We hope this
survey will contribute to advancing both academic research and industrial applica-
tions in the field of spoken dialogue systems. The related material is available at

1 Introduction
Spoken dialogue models [ 44,243,224] represent one of the most direct methods of human-computer
interaction, evolving from traditional voice assistants such as Alexa3, Siri4, and Google Assistant5
to the latest intelligent dialogue systems, such as GPT-4o6. The fundamental definition of a spoken
dialogue model refers to a dialogue system capable of generating intelligent verbal responses based on
the input speech. On the one hand, the speech modality serves as both the input and output interface

for the human-computer interaction in the spoken dialogue models. On the other hand, the dialogue
system [52] requires the model to possess a certain level of textual intelligence, including the ability
to comprehend the knowledge of human society and generating professional and intelligent responses.
Recently, intelligent spoken dialogue systems, exemplified by GPT-4o and Moshi [ 44], have garnered
significant attention for their ability to extend speech intelligence capabilities beyond traditional
text-based dialogue models [ 85]. These dialogue models can not only generate natural, human-
like speech responses [ 44,196] but also demonstrate an advanced understanding and generation of
acoustic features beyond text, such as timbre, emotion, and style [ 128,129,228]. Additionally, they
exhibit strong performance in processing other speech-related representations, including music and
audio events [ 33,34,67,199]. Their realistic conversational interactivity [ 61,224] and low-latency
dialogue experiences [44] further distinguish them among the traditional spoken dialogue models.
The history of spoken dialogue models can be traced back to early systems like dGSLM [ 158] and
AudioGPT [ 85], leading up to more recent advancements such as GPT-4o and Moshi [ 44]. During
this period, many notable spoken dialogue models have emerged. As shown in Figure 1, we have
organized these models in chronological order. Broadly, they can be categorized into two types:
cascaded spoken dialogue models [ 33,34] and end-to-end [ 150,223,247,249] spoken dialogue
models. Given that most current spoken dialogue models rely on alignment with the text modality,
the distinction between cascaded and end-to-end models is crucial. As illustrated in Figure 2,
we classify all spoken dialogue models based on whether the core language model can directly
understand and generate speech representations , dividing them into cascaded and end-to-end
categories. Traditional cascaded spoken dialogue systems such as AudioGPT [ 85] are structured
around text as the central intermediary, typically comprising three cascaded modules. First, the
input audio is transcribed into text by an automatic speech recognition (ASR) module [ 170]. The
transcribed text is then fed into a large language model (LLM) such as ChatGPT to generate a textual
response. Finally, this textual response is converted back into audio through a text-to-speech (TTS)
module [ 110,177]. While this cascaded architecture leverages the strong in-context capabilities of
large language models, it introduces several challenges, including high latency, limited interactivity,
and the inability to process non-textual information. To address these issues, recent research has
taken two primary directions. Some approaches [ 34,199] focus on optimizing the understanding and
generation components within the cascaded system to mitigate the aforementioned limitations. Some
other approach [ 223,224,245,249] seek to directly solve these problems by adopting end-to-end
architectures for spoken dialogue systems. Although end-to-end spoken dialogue models exhibit
various differences in terms of representations and model architectures, they share a common feature:
they do not rely on text as the central intermediary. Instead, these models aim to directly comprehend
and generate speech representations. We define such systems as end-to-end spoken dialogue models.
When constructing spoken dialogue systems, we identify four core technologies closely related to
spoken dialogue models, based on the different levels of intelligence involved. The first is the design
of speech representations (i.e., tokenizers and detokenizers). The second concerns the paradigm
for training, inference, and generation, specifically how to align the speech modality with the text
modality while preserving or enhancing the intelligence of existing text-based dialogue models.
This part also involves selecting different model architectures, generation strategies, and multi-stage
training approaches. The third challenge involves the design of interactive, duplex, streaming for
spoken dialogue systems. Lastly, the fourth challenge relates to data—specifically, how to construct
training datasets for spoken dialogue systems and evaluate their performance.
Given these considerations, in the following sections of this paper, we address these four key
technologies in the order outlined above. In Section 2, we provide an overview of spoken dialogue
systems, including typical spoken dialogue scenarios (i.e., how to define a spoken dialogue model)
and recent developments in the cascaded and end-to-end spoken dialogue models. Section 3 focuses
on the speech representations used in spoken dialogue systems. In Section 4, we systematically
discuss the training paradigms, with particular emphasis on how to align the speech modality with the
text modality, as well as multi-stage training strategies, model architectures, and generation strategies.
Section 5 highlights the unique characteristics of spoken dialogue systems, particularly their duplex,
streaming nature, which distinguishes them from text-based dialogue systems. In Section 6, we
examine the construction of training datasets and the evaluation methodologies specific to spoken
dialogue models. At the end of each section, we include a summary and discussion to reflect on the
key insights. Finally, in Section 7, we conclude the survey by summarizing the major findings and

discussing open issues for future research. Given the complexity of the technical points, we provide
an overview of the structure of this survey in Figure 3.
2 Overall
In this section, we will provide an overall overview of spoken dialogue models. we begin by defining
what constitutes an intelligent spoken dialogue model by examining various dialogue scenarios. We
then provide a comprehensive overview of spoken dialogue models, distinguishing between cascaded
spoken dialogue models and end-to-end spoken dialogue models.
2.1 Functions of Spoken Dialogue Systems
Based on the demos and inference interfaces of representative models such as GPT-4o, Moshi [ 44],
Qwen2-Audio [ 33], and VITA [ 61], we categorize the usage scenarios of modern intelligent spoken
dialogue models into the following nine representative categories: 1) Text Intelligence, 2) Speech
Intelligence, 3) Audio and Music Generation, 4) Audio and Music Understanding, 5) Multilingual
Capability, 6) Context Learning, 7) Interaction Capability, 8) Streaming Latency, and 9) Multimodal
Capability. For the nine distinct use cases in spoken dialogue models, we provide corresponding
examples for each scenario in Figure 4. It is clear from these usage scenarios that a spoken dialogue
model is not simply an extension of a text-based dialogue model to the speech modality (i.e., where
the speech modality serves merely as an interface for converting speech into text). Rather, an
intelligent spoken dialogue system must be capable of comprehending and generating acoustic
information embedded in speech (such as timbre, style, and emotion) and of understanding and
producing a wider range of audio representations, including information related to audio events
and music. Additionally, unlike non-streaming text-based systems, spoken dialogue models need to
support real-time, interactive streaming capabilities. These usage scenarios not only highlight the
intelligence inherent in spoken dialogue systems but also present significant challenges for building
end-to-end spoken dialogue models. Below, we provide a detailed examination of each of the nine
usage scenarios.

Figure 2: A general overview of current spoken dialogue systems. We categorize these systems into
two paradigms, cascaded spoken dialogue models and end-to-end spoken dialogue models, based
on whether the core language model can directly understand and generate speech representations.
Additionally, we provide a visualization of the input and output methods used in different spoken
dialogue systems.
2.1.1 Text Intelligence
As illustrated in Figure 4 (a), a spoken dialogue system must retain the fundamental capabilities of
the original text-based dialogue models, such as ChatGPT. We define this usage scenario as textual
intelligence. In this context, the spoken dialogue model can intelligently respond to user requests,
generating appropriate responses such as travel itineraries, work plans, and scheduling. However,
due to the limitations of voice-based interaction, the textual intelligence of current spoken dialogue
systems is more focused on the daily scenarios. In certain contexts, such as complex mathematical
theorem reasoning, the performance requirements for spoken dialogue models differ from those of
text-based dialogue models [ 201]. These advanced aspects of textual intelligence warrant further
exploration in unified multimodal dialogue models.
2.1.2 Speech Intelligence
A distinguishing feature of spoken dialogue models, compared to text-based dialogue models [ 201],
is their ability to understand and generate acoustic information beyond mere textual content. In the
speech modality, not only is the textual content present, but also additional acoustic information,
such as timbre (speaker identity) and style (emotion, prosody, etc.). As illustrated in Figure 4 (b), an
intelligent spoken dialogue system should be capable of understanding the timbre and style

of conversational speech and, ideally, generating responses with specified timbre and style in a
zero-shot manner.
This capability about speech intelligence involves several use cases. First, on the comprehension
side, the spoken dialogue system should generate responses based on the speaker’s vocal style. For
example, in the E-chat [ 228], a classic example might be: if a user asks, "My phone won’t turn on,
what should I do?" in a cheerful tone, the system might respond, "It looks like you’re excited about
getting a new phone. What type of phone are you interested in?" Conversely, if the user asks the
same question in a sad tone, the system might reply, "It’s unfortunate your phone isn’t working. If
you’re familiar with the repair policy, let’s proceed with the next steps." This situation indicates that
the spoken dialogue system may generate responses with different content based on varying acoustic
information. Furthermore, the system should comprehend various acoustic cues, such as accents or
emotional states, and adjust its responses of different acoustic information accordingly. For instance,
if the speaker is an American, the system might reply with a native English accent, whereas if the
speaker is a Shanghainese user, the system could respond using the corresponding dialect. Similarly,
if the user speaks with a sad tone, the dialogue system should be able to generate a more encouraging
and empathetic response.
On the generation side, speech intelligence is more prominently reflected in its controllability, such
as voice cloning and style control. For example, the system could be instructed to mimic a specific
voice or respond in a designated style (e.g., mimicking a grandmother’s soft and gentle voice for
a comforting interaction). Additionally, the system could use a voice prompt provided during the
conversation to fully clone the timbre from the prompt and generate speech in that same voice. In
summary, the ability to comprehend and generate acoustic information is one of the key characteristics
of an intelligent spoken dialogue model.
2.1.3 Audio and Music Generation
In the spoken dialogue models, beyond basic spoken dialogue capabilities, an intelligent spoken
dialogue system may be required to generate music and audio. For example, a user might instruct the
system to generate a one-minute piano piece or a ten-second recording of a dog barking. Additionally,
users might provide lyrics and a musical melody, asking the spoken dialogue model to create a pop
song. The system should thus inherit the generative capabilities of large-scale music [ 2,40,117,142]
and audio [84, 135, 137] models on the output side.
2.1.4 Audio and Music Understanding
Complementing its music and audio generation capabilities, a spoken dialogue model should also
be able to understand music and audio on the input side [ 33,199]. For instance, when given an
audio clip, the intelligent system should identify both its content and acoustic characteristics, such
as recognizing whether the sound is a bird chirping or a cat meowing, or whether the music is calm
or energetic. Moreover, the system could extend its understanding by creating literary works—like
poetry or songs—based on the given music or audio.
2.1.5 Multilingual Capability
Similar to text-based dialogue models, spoken dialogue systems are expected to possess multilingual
capabilities. Specifically, these models should be able to perform multilingual content translation,
such as translating a spoken segment in Japanese into French speech clips, effectively inheriting
the capabilities of simultaneous interpretation. In addition to multilingual content translation, the
system should also handle multilingual acoustic information. This means that the intelligent spoken
dialogue model should be able to generate responses in various languages and accents, replying in
the corresponding accent of the target language based on the different input speech.
2.1.6 Context Learning
In the spoken dialogue models, the ability to handle long-form and multi-turn conversations is a key
benchmark for evaluating performance [ 44]. This requires that spoken dialogue models not only
support long-duration audio inputs but also generate extended audio outputs. Moreover, they must
be capable of engaging in multi-turn conversations based on historical context. An important aspect
of multi-turn dialogue is the ability to revise previous responses based on new user instructions. As

Figure 4: An overall demonstration of the functions of the spoken dialogue systems. We describe
the ideal capabilities of such systems from nine different perspectives: Text Intelligence, Speech
Intelligence, Audio and Music Generation, Audio and Music Understanding, Multilingual Capability,
Context Learning, Interaction Capability, Streaming Latency, and Multimodal Capability. Each
function is illustrated with corresponding dialogue examples.
shown in Figure 4 (f), an intelligent spoken dialogue model should be able to continuously modify its
previous replies according to the user’s evolving requests.
2.1.7 Interaction Capability
A distinguishing feature of spoken dialogue systems compared to the text-based dialogue models
is their duplex and interactive nature [ 44]. In text-based dialogue, interactions typically follow a
half-duplex structure, where the response can only be provided after the question has been completed,
and the user is unable to interrupt the reply in real-time. However, in the spoken dialogue systems,
full-duplex interaction is common. This means that a conversation does not need to be fully completed
before a response can be generated. Both the system and the user can interrupt and interact in real time.
For example, if the user is unsatisfied with the system’s response, they can immediately interrupt,
causing the system to halt its current generation and respond to the new input. Additionally, to emulate
more natural conversational settings, the system can also interrupt the user when appropriate, such as
when clarifying the user’s intent. Beyond the ability to interrupt, interactive dialogue often includes
the use of conversational fillers, such as "okay," "haha," or "oh," which signal acknowledgment or
agreement. Including these within spoken dialogue models enhances the realism and natural flow of
conversations. The underlying requirement for interaction capabilities is that the system should be
able to listen and speak simultaneously, responding dynamically to the flow of the interaction.

2.1.8 Streaming Latency
Streaming comprehension and generation are also fundamental functionalities of spoken dialogue
models [ 224,249,57]. In the real-world scenarios, a model cannot wait until an entire minute-long
audio segment has been processed before generating a response. Instead, the model must operate on
a chunk-based mechanism, dynamically processing and generating audio in real time, one chunk at a
time. Additionally, the streaming requirement means that the entire system must operate in a causal
manner—understanding and generating audio based solely on past information, without relying on
future information. Streaming function is often closely tied to the need for low latency. In practical
conversational experiences, the latency of the first token generated by the spoken dialogue model
(i.e., the wait time for the user) and the average latency of the generation process are critical factors
that influence the overall responsiveness and usability of the spoken dialogue system.
2.1.9 Multimodal Capability
Multimodal dialogue capability [ 25,61] represents an advanced feature of spoken dialogue models.
In existing systems, this typically refers to the ability to process inputs from multiple modalities,
such as video, images, and text, while generating intelligent speech responses. A spoken dialogue
model equipped with this capability achieves the ability to “hear, see, and speak” simultaneously.
Multimodal inputs significantly enhance the potential of these systems; for instance, users can employ
various gestures to improve the quality of the model’s generated responses, and the system can
develop a deeper understanding of the physical world. Beyond multimodal inputs, the future of
dialogue systems lies in large multimodal models that unify the comprehension and generation
capabilities across all modalities, with spoken dialogue serving as the foundational modality.
2.2 Cascaded Spoken Dialogue Systems
The earliest prototype of cascaded spoken dialogue systems can be traced back to AudioGPT [ 85].
To achieve speech-to-speech dialogue functionality, the system first employed an Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) model to convert speech into text, followed by ChatGPT for text-based dialogue,
and finally, a Text-to-Speech (TTS) model to convert the generated text back into speech. In this
primitive version, speech was used solely as an input-output interface, retaining only the most basic
textual intelligence. For example, in the Huggingface’s open-source Speech-To-Speech framework7,
an additional V oice Activity Detection (V AD) module8was further layered onto the traditional
cascaded modules to distinguish between speech and silent segments, as well as between different
speakers.
After the basic textual intelligence had been established in the cascaded spoken dialogue models,
researchers began incorporating paralinguistic features, such as emotion and style, to enhance the
speech intelligence in the cascaded spoken dialogue models. For instance, ParalinGPT [ 129] and
E-chat [ 228] integrate conversational context, speech embeddings, and paralinguistic attributes into
an autoregressive model via a sliding window, allowing the model to generate more accurate text
responses by combining historical text and emotional representations. Similarly, Spoken-LLM [ 128]
introduces an Emotion2Vec [ 144] module to provide style vectors to the Llama2-Chat model. Through
LoRA [ 80] fine-tuning, Llama2-Chat is trained not only to generate content-based text responses but
also to produce text responses with specific stylistic attributes (e.g., <cheerful, fast, normal>), which
can guide downstream TTS systems in generating expressive speech.
In addition to understanding acoustic information within cascaded spoken dialogue models, there have
been efforts to directly input speech representations while retaining text as the output modality [ 41,
34,112]. This forces cascaded spoken dialogue systems to process input speech directly. A common
approach involves integrating frozen speech encoders (such as Whisper [ 170]) with trainable encoder
adapters, allowing the speech input to be interpreted as a specialized form of text by the large language
model. By extending the vocabulary of the text-based dialogue model, the large language model
can process speech as if it were a unique form of text, enabling the generation of appropriate text
responses in the cascaded spoken dialogue models.

Notably, these cascaded spoken dialogue models have further advanced beyond the comprehension
of human speech alone and can now understand a variety of audio modalities, including music
and audio [ 67,199]. For example, SALMONN [ 199] models both speech and audio information
by freezing the Whisper [ 170] and BEATs [ 28] encoder and bridging them to a large language
model via a Window-Level Q-Former [ 122]. As a result, these cascaded spoken dialogue systems
are capable of further performing a wide range of tasks on the comprehension side. For instance,
models like Qwen-audio [ 33,34] can handle multiple tasks such as Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR), Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT), Automatic Audio Captioning (AAC), Acoustic Scene
Classification (ASC), Speech Emotion Recognition (SER), Audio Question Answering (AQA), V ocal
Sound Classification (VSC), and Music Note Analysis (MNA). Consequently, these cascaded models
are often regarded as part of multitask speech-text large language models.
It is worth noting that the aforementioned cascaded spoken dialogue models generate text only and
then directly feed it into a pre-trained TTS module. However, more recent cascaded spoken dialogue
models, such as Llama3.1, have begun integrating trainable TTS modules as part of the decoder
within the large language model (LLM). While these models have made progress in incorporating
low-latency streaming functionalities, they are still fundamentally based on generating text content
first, which is then converted into speech. They do not directly generate speech-related representations
within the LLM itself. Therefore, we classify these models as cascaded spoken dialogue systems.
In addition, some recent efforts have focused on enhancing models like Qwen2-Audio [ 33] by
incorporating multimodal comprehension capabilities, thereby enabling a degree of multimodal
dialogue functionality. For instance, models such as VITA [ 61] and Baichuan-Omni[ 123] integrate
various encoders or tokenizers for images, audio, and video into the LLM, allowing the model to
understand multimodal inputs and generate corresponding text responses.
The above developments concern the comprehension side of cascaded spoken dialogue systems.
On the generation side, two main types of speech synthesis work are relevant to cascaded spoken
dialogue systems. Firstly, there has been a recent surge of advanced speech synthesis systems that can
produce highly expressive and natural audio based on textual input, such as V ALL-E (X) [ 210,251],
MegaTTS1/2 [ 97,98], CosyV oice [ 49], ChatTTS9, FishSpeech10, ParlerTTS [ 141], MaskGCT [ 217]
and F5-TTS [ 30]. In addition, there has been significant progress in the field of text-style controllable
TTS, with systems like TextrolSpeech [ 93], PromptTTS [ 71], PromptTTS2 [ 119], InstructTTS [ 232],
and ControlSpeech [ 94]. These TTS systems can generate highly natural audio based both on the
content and style of the text output produced by the cascaded spoken dialogue models.
2.3 End-to-End Spoken Dialogue Systems
Ideally, end-to-end spoken dialogue models should enable only speech input and output during
both training and inference, thereby achieving multiple intelligent dialogue functions. However,
considering that speech modal is a low-density (contains a lot of acoustic information) modality
compared to text modal, and that the volume of available text data far exceeds that of available speech
data, many end-to-end spoken dialogue models choose to align the speech modality with the text
modality to leverage pre-trained language models (LLMs). Consequently, as showed in the Figure 2,
as long as the large language models can directly understand and generate speech representations,
we classify such systems as end-to-end spoken dialogue models. In contrast, if the large language
models can only generate text, we categorize the system as cascaded spoken dialogue systems.
The earliest end-to-end spoken dialogue system can be traced back to dGSLM [ 158], which was
trained on thousands of hours of dual-track data [ 37] using self-attention and cross-attention mecha-
nisms to simulate duplex interactions. Although dGSLM lacks integration with LLMs and even basic
textual intelligence, it is notable as the first fully end-to-end spoken dialogue system that does not
rely on text while maintaining excellent conversational interactivity.
Following the release of dGSLM [ 158], the progress in the domain of end-to-end spoken dialogue
systems stagnated for a few months. However, with the advent of ChatGPT, this field experienced
rapid development. A representative approach is SpeechGPT [ 243], which employs autoregressive
language modeling by using a sequence of speech tokens, text tokens, text tokens, and speech tokens.
This method enables the direct generation of speech tokens using textual intelligence, inspiring

subsequent end-to-end spoken dialogue systems such as Spectron [ 147], SpeechGPT-Gen [ 245],
GLM-4-V oice11, and EMOV A [ 25]. These systems continue to use an autoregressive framework,
generating the text tokens followed by the speech tokens. Although this approach allows LLMs to
generate speech tokens directly, it introduces latency issues since speech token generation cannot
begin until the generation of text tokens is complete. This leads to problems in multi-turn dialogue
and overall system delay.
Beyond the design of SpeechGPT [ 243], another intuitive approach is to directly use the hidden
states before the LLM’s softmax layer to predict both text tokens and speech tokens through different
projection layers. This allows the network to share weights up to the projection layer, thereby aligning
the speech and text modalities. The PSLM [ 155] model is a typical example of this design. Another
method, proposed by Meta, is the interleaving approach, as seen in Spirit-LM [ 159], where speech and
text sequences are concatenated into a single token stream and trained using a word-level interleaving
method with a small, automatically curated speech-text parallel corpus. However, this approach
requires precise alignment between speech and text.
Recently, several new end-to-end spoken dialogue systems have emerged. For instance, Moshi [ 44],
which is based on a global-local transformer, can simultaneously generate text and speech acoustic
tokens from a multi-layer quantizer. Starting from a text-based language model backbone, Moshi
generates speech tokens from the residual quantizer of a neural audio codec while modeling both
the user’s speech and the system’s responses in parallel streams. This design eliminates the need for
explicit speaker turns and allows for the modeling of arbitrary conversational dynamics. Moreover,
Moshi extends previous hierarchical semantic-to-acoustic token generation by first predicting time-
aligned text tokens as a prefix to audio tokens. Similarly, Mini-Omni [ 223] uses a MusicGen-
based [ 40] method to simultaneously generate text and speech codec tokens. It introduces two
strategies: autoregressive generation without strict temporal alignment by padding text tokens
and batch-parallel inference strategies to boost performance. Mini-Omni2 [ 224] further enhances
this by incorporating multimodal understanding and duplex functionality. At the same time, Llama-
Omni [ 57], Freeze-Omni [ 213] and IntrinsicV oice [ 249] design an LLM for real-time voice interaction.
Their commonality lies in the fact that, at the generation stage, the hidden states of the LLM are
further fed into the corresponding decoder model. LLaMA-Omni [ 57] integrates a pretrained speech
encoder, a speech adapter, an LLM, and a streaming speech decoder. It eliminates the need for
speech transcription, and can simultaneously generate text and speech responses directly from speech
instructions with low latency. Freeze-Omni [ 213] designed 3-stage training strategies both for the
modeling of speech input and output, enabling it to obtain speech-to-speech dialogue ability noly by
using text-speech paired data. The core idea of Freeze-Omni lies in transferring the functionalities of
spoken dialogue models to the encoder (ASR) and decoder (TTS), rather than assigning these tasks
to the large language model. IntrinsicV oice [ 249] facilitates the transfer of textual capabilities from
pre-trained LLMs to the speech modality by reducing the modality gap between text and speech.
By using a GroupFormer to generate HuBERT tokens from the LLM’s hidden states, IntrinsicV oice
effectively reduces speech sequences to lengths comparable to text sequences, generating high-
quality audio while significantly speeding up inference and mitigating long-text modeling issues.
Additionally, some end-to-end spoken dialogue models align speech and text through multi-stage
training, eliminating the need to generate text during inference. For example, Omni-Flatten [ 247]
employs modality alignment, half-duplex dialogue learning, and full-duplex dialogue learning, along
with a flattening-style standardization of text and speech tokens, to achieve duplex, text-free speech
dialogue during inference. Similar approaches include SyncLLM [204].
In this section, we have provided a general overview of current end-to-end spoken dialogue systems.
However, these systems differ significantly in their speech representations, training paradigm, model
architectures and generation strategy. In Section 3 and 4, we will present a detailed classificationfol-
lowed by our discussions at the end of each section.
3 Representations of Spoken Dialogue Models
Representations play a critical role in spoken dialogue systems as they determine how the spoken
dialogue system comprehends, processes, and generates speech signals. Additionally, they serve
as a bridge between speech and other modalities, thereby directly influencing the system’s perfor-

mance, functionality, and range of applications. Compared to text and visual representations, speech
representations possess a unique complexity. Text representations primarily rely on a well-defined
symbolic system, conveying meaning through structured elements like vocabulary and syntax. Visual
representations, on the other hand, focus on capturing spatial relationships and visual features in
images. In contrast, speech signals contain both dynamic acoustic features (such as timbre, prosody
and emotion) and rich semantic content, requiring representations that not only capture temporal
variations but also preserve an understanding of the underlying meaning.
The unique nature of speech has led to the development of two types of representation models. The
representations obtained by these two modeling approaches are often classified as semantic tokens
and acoustic tokens. One category (semantic) is prediction-based modeling , these models are
trained for representation learning by predicting future frames in an autoregressive manner [ 35,188]
or by using surrounding frames to predict masked frames [ 31,79,134]. This approach tends to
prioritize capturing linguistic information within speech, making it particularly useful for recognition
and understanding tasks. The other category (acoustic) focuses on speech compression and
reconstruction [92,43,114,239]. These models quantify speech features (which are downsampled
from raw wavforms by one encoder) into a series of discrete tokens, then use one decoder to upsample
these discrete tokens into the speech, calculating the reconstruction loss against the original signal. By
this approach, we can get discrete acoustic tokens with impressive compression rates and high-fidelity
acoustic information, making it more suitable for tasks such as speech synthesis and emotion analysis.
In the spoken dialogue systems, as illustrated in Figure 2, different spoken dialogue models em-
ploy various approaches for representation selection. In the following part, we will enumerate the
commonly used speech representations in spoken dialogue models from both the input and output
perspectives. At the end of this section, we will thoroughly discuss the advantages and limitations
of these representations, as well as the future trends in the development of representations used in
spoken dialogue models.
3.1 Speech Representations at the Inputs
Semantic. To enhance language models’ ability to understand speech representations and align
multimodal data at input, using pretrained models such as Wav2Vec [ 185], HuBERT [ 79], Whisper
[170], and WavLM [ 27] to extract high-level semantic features from speech has become a core
strategy for many spoken dialogue systems.
•Wav2Vec. Wav2Vec [ 185] is a foundational work in the field of speech representation learning,
pioneering the extraction of self-supervised speech representations from unlabeled speech data.
This approach has driven technological advancements in tasks such as speech recognition, speaker
identification, and other speech processing applications. Wav2Vec employs a multi-layer, one-
dimensional convolutional neural network directly on raw speech waveforms to progressively extract
temporal speech features. Training is accomplished through contrastive learning: the model selects
a "correct" target (from the current speech frame) alongside several "incorrect" targets (negative
samples). By learning to distinguish positive samples from negatives, the model effectively learns
to represent speech features in latent space. As an improved version of Wav2Vec, Wav2Vec 2.0
[10] introduces the Transformer architecture and masked modeling. Wav2Vec 2.0 quantizes the
latent speech representations extracted by the CNN and then uses a Transformer to model semantic
information, similar to BERT [ 45]. It also employs a contrastive learning objective, requiring the
model to distinguish the correct quantized representations from multiple candidate representations.
ParalinGPT [ 129] aims to incorporate emotional expression in conversational interactions, choosing
Wav2Vec 2.0 for its proven capability to encode rich prosodic information, beneficial for speech
emotion recognition [ 124]. Specifically, ParalinGPT uses Wav2Vec 2.0’s intermediate layer (the
12th layer) for frame-by-frame feature extraction, as this layer has shown optimal results in linear
probing tasks for emotion analysis. Additionally, ParalinGPT applies mean pooling and a linear
feature projector to extract utterance embeddings.
•XLS-R. XLS-R [ 9] is a multilingual self-supervised speech representation model based on the
Wav2Vec 2.0 architecture. It extends and optimizes Wav2Vec 2.0 to support a broader range of
languages, particularly low-resource languages. During cross-lingual training, XLS-R employs
multilingual data augmentation and denoising techniques, enhancing the model’s adaptability when
processing speech in various languages. USDM [ 107] uses XLS-R to obtain continuous intermediate
representations at 50Hz, followed by a quantizer [14] with K=10000 to generate speech tokens.
11

•HuBERT. HuBERT [ 79] is a commonly used unsupervised learning model that performs K-Means
clustering on the MFCC [ 252] features of speech to assign pseudo-labels to each frame. It uses a
convolutional encoder to generate a sequence of features at a 20ms frame rate from 16kHz sampled
speech. Finally, it randomly masks a portion of features from consecutive frames as input to the
Transformer [ 202]. HuBERT generates masked content based on surrounding context, enabling it
to capture temporal and semantic information within speech and gain a deeper understanding of
contextual details. Spoken dialogue systems, such as E-Chat [ 228], SpeechGPT [ 243], PSLM [ 155],
IntrinsicV oice [ 249], widely use HuBERT as their speech encoder. E-Chat extracts the weighted sum
of the 24 layers from the HuBERT to serve as speech embeddings, and incorporates an additional set
of weighted parameters to extract emotion embeddings, thereby enabling emotion-aware capabilities.
SpeechGPT applies K-Means clustering to quantize the continuous features extracted from HuBERT,
converting them into discrete unit sequences. These discrete units are then integrated into the
vocabulary of the large language model, enabling direct alignment between the text and speech
modalities. To more effectively integrate the language model with speech streams, PSLM adds an
additional embedding layer after extracting features with HuBERT. IntrinsicV oice uses HuBERT
as the speech tokenizer, grouping speech tokens to reduce sequence length. An embedding layer
then converts these tokens into dense embeddings, which are subsequently mapped into the language
model’s embedding space using a trainable speech adapter. Spirit-LM [ 159] extracts semantic features
using HuBERT, employing a K-Means model with 500 units as the basic unit. It trains a feedforward
quantizer with data augmentation techniques [ 64] to produce discrete speech tokens. In the Align-
SLM [ 130], HuBERT is used and the cluster number K is set to 500. Notably, when continuous
representations are clustered into discrete units, they primarily capture content information, which can
be leveraged for modeling and understanding. This process first extracts 25Hz frame-level continuous
representations from the 11-th layer of the HuBERT model, assigns each frame to its closest cluster
index, and then de-duplicates consecutive identical indices to shorten the sequence.
•Whisper. Whisper [ 170], based on the classic encoder-decoder architecture, has gained
widespread attention in the field of speech recognition. The encoder transforms input speech into
high-level feature representations, while the decoder generates the corresponding text output from
these representations. Pretrained on large-scale data across various speech environments with text as
the target, Whisper demonstrates strong capabilities in extracting semantic information from speech.
Qwen-Audio [ 34], Qwen-Audio 2 [ 33] use Whisper’s encoder to convert speech into continuous
representations, which are then combined with text representations and fed into the large language
model. Mini-Omni [ 223], Mini-Omni 2 [ 224], and LLama-Omni [ 57] follow a similar approach,
connecting a speech adapter after the Whisper encoder. Their shared objective is to map speech
representations into the text embedding space of the large language model, enhancing the model’s
ability to understand speech by forcibly aligning them through vocabulary expansion.
•WavLM. WavLM [ 27] is a pretrained model designed for comprehensive speech processing
tasks, playing a critical role in advancing speech technology. Specifically, WavLM employs a
masked speech denoising and prediction framework, where some inputs consist of simulated noise or
overlapping speech with masked sections. The goal is to predict pseudo-labels of the original speech
in the masked areas. This approach enables the model to learn ASR-related information through
masked speech prediction, while also gaining knowledge relevant to non-ASR tasks through speech
denoising modeling. The masking and prediction pipeline for speech frames in WavLM is similar to
that of HuBERT. However, WavLM introduces an additional gated relative position bias to enhance
the model’s sensitivity to temporal information in speech. SpeechVerse [ 41] leverages the pretrained
WavLM Large as its backbone speech encoder, encoding all intermediate layer features from WavLM
to capture various forms of semantics and achieve better generalization performance. To address the
significant length disparity between speech features and text tokens, SpeechVerse applies a learnable
convolutional module for downsampling the speech features.
•S3Tokenizer. CosyV oice [ 49] proposes using a supervised automatic speech recognition module
to generate a supervised semantic speech( S3) tokenizer. Unlike a standard ASR model, the S3
tokenizer splits the encoder into two parts and introduces a vector quantization layer in between.
The first encoder converts the mel spectrogram into context-aware representations, while the second
encoder transforms discrete speech units into continuous hidden states. Finally, a Transformer-based
ASR decoder predicts the posterior probabilities of text labels. Through supervision in multilingual
ASR tasks, the S3tokenizer can convert speech into semantically consistent tokens that facilitate both
12

speech understanding and generation. OmniFlatten [ 247] uses the S3tokenizer to extract discrete
speech tokens, which are then directly fed into a text-speech pre-trained Transformer.
•SPIRAL. SPIRAL [ 86] aims to learn representations from speech data that are robust to noise and
perturbations. It uses a teacher-student network, where various perturbations—such as noise addition,
gain adjustment, and time-frequency warping—are applied to the speech input of the student model.
The teacher model then guides the student model to produce consistent representations despite these
perturbations. EMOV A [ 25] utilizes the SPIRAL’s architecture as a speech encoder to process speech,
and employs the finite scalar quantization [ 150] to discretize these features. This process aligns
speech with the text vocabulary, allowing for a more natural integration into the LLM.
•Others. Some spoken dialogue systems do not use pre-trained representation models; instead,
they process input features by stacking fundamental modules. VITA [ 61] initially decomposes the
speech signal using mel filter banks, mimicking the nonlinear perception of sound in humans. It
then processes the input features with a 4-layer CNN downsampling module followed by a 24-layer
Transformer. To align with the subsequent language model, VITA employs a simple 2-layer MLP
as an adapter. Freeze-Omni [ 214] utilizes a chunk-wise streaming speech encoder to transform
input speech features into high-dimensional representations. An adapter module then maps these
high-dimensional representations into the embedding space of the main LLM, ensuring a quick, low-
latency response to the input speech. The speech encoder module consists of several downsampling
convolutional layers and Transformer blocks, while the adapter includes only a few downsampling
convolutional layers. Downsampling layers are used to reduce the frame rate of speech features,
increase the LLM’s processing speed during the prefill phase, and minimize latency.
Acoustic. Considering that semantic features are insufficient to capture the emotion, timbre, and
style of speech, some representation models, such as Emotion2Vec [ 144], attempt to extract acoustic
information through self-supervised training. Others focus on reconstruction objectives to ensure
high-fidelity speech, including models like Encodec [43], SpeechTokenizer [250], Mimi [44].
•Encodec. EnCodec [ 43] is a straightforward, streaming, convolution-based encoder-decoder
architecture. Raw speech is downsampled through a series of convolutional layers, mapping it to
latent feature representations. Residual vector quantization [ 239] then discretizes the encoder’s
continuous latent features. The quantization objective is to map continuous features to a predefined
set of discrete tokens (known as a "codebook") for subsequent compression and transmission. The
decoder restores the discrete features to a waveform close to the original speech through a series
of de-convolution layers. LauraGPT [ 50] employs an enhanced version of EnCodec as its speech
encoder with specific modifications: (1) adding a reconstruction loss in the magnitude spectral domain
to improve mid-to-high frequency signal quality; (2) stacking five strided convolutional blocks with
strides of (8, 5, 4, 2, 2) to address the challenges of long sequence lengths, resulting in a token rate of
25Hz per token group; and (3) using 32 quantizers with structured dropout in the Residual Vector
Quantization (RVQ) module, each with a vocabulary size of 1024. This revision increases speech
quality by incorporating more quantizers while preserving most information in the shallow quantizers.
LauraGPT ultimately selects the output from the first quantizer layer as the speech token, balancing
performance with sequence length efficiency. The remaining quantizers are used only during the
training of the encoder-decoder model.
•SpeechTokenizer. SpeechTokenizer [ 250] unifies semantic and acoustic tokens, hierarchically
decomposing different aspects of speech information across various RVQ layers. It is built on
the framework of RVQ-GANs, following the same pattern as SoundStream [ 239] and EnCodec
[43]. Notably, SpeechTokenizer has substituted the two-layer LSTM, originally following the
convolution blocks in the EnCodec encoder, with a two-layer BiLSTM to augment the semantic
modeling ability. SpeechTokenizer uses HuBERT as a semantic teacher, given HuBERT’s proven
capacity to encode substantial content information [ 156]. During training, it introduces two types
of distillation: continuous representation distillation and pseudo-label prediction. For continuous
representation distillation, SpeechTokenizer employs the 9th layer HuBERT representation or the
average representation across all HuBERT layers as semantic teachers. The training objective is to
maximize the cosine similarity at the dimension level across all timesteps between the outputs of
RVQ first layer and semantic teacher representations. For pseudo-label prediction, SpeechTokenizer
adopts HuBERT units as the target label. In dialogue systems, SpeechGPT-Gen uses SpeechTokenizer
RVQ-1 to process raw speech, primarily enhancing the large language model’s ability to model the
semantics of speech.
13

•Mimi. Taking inspiration from previous work on SpeechTokenizer, Mimi [ 44] uses distillation
to transfer non-causal, high-level semantic information into the tokens produced by a causal model,
allowing for streaming encoding and decoding of semantic-acoustic tokens. To improve the ability
of Mimi to encode speech into compact representations while reconstructing high-quality speech,
Transformer modules are added in the encoder and decoder. Mimi uses WavLM to distill RVQ-1,
enriching it with semantic information. Notably, performing distillation significantly enhances the
speech discrimination capability of the first quantizer; however, it can also negatively impact speech
quality. Mimi hypothesizes that this is due to distilling semantic information into the first level of
a single RVQ: As higher-order quantizers operate on the residual of the first one, the latter needs
to trade speech quality for phonetic discriminability. Mimi addresses this issue by introducing a
split-RVQ approach. Instead of using a single 8-level RVQ, it extracts semantic information into a
simple VQ and applies a parallel 7-level RVQ, combining their outputs at the end. This removes
the constraint that acoustic information must be preserved in the residuals of the semantic quantizer.
After careful design, Mimi serves as the speech encoder in Moshi [ 44], this approach enhances the
model’s ability to capture both semantic and acoustic details.
•Emotion2Vec. Emotion2Vec [ 144] is a versatile speech emotion representation model designed
to extract emotional features from speech. During the pre-training phase, Emotion2Vec conducts
online distillation with a teacher network and a student network. When a specific downstream task is
performed, Emotion2Vec is frozen and a lightweight downstream model is trained. Emotion2Vec
introduces an utterance-level loss to control global emotion and employs a frame-level loss to build a
frame-wise pretext task, enabling it to learn contextual emotions. Spoken-LLM [ 128] uses features
extracted by Emotion2Vec as input for the large language model, aiming to enable the model to
understand and respond to emotions.
3.2 Speech Representations at the Outputs
Semantic. At the output stage, Most spoken dialogue systems choose to autoregressively model
semantic tokens, such as S3tokens [ 49] and HuBERT [ 79] units. It is worth noting that these semantic
tokens lack acoustic conditioning and therefore require a vocoder [ 109,167] or decoder, which futher
takes semantic discrete units as input to synthesize speech consistent with the speakers encountered
during training.
•S3Tokenizer. OmniFlatten [ 247] uses the LLM to autoregressively predict S3tokens at the
speech output stage. When converting discrete tokens back into speech, it adopts the same optimal
transport conditional flow matching model (OT-CFM) as used in CosyV oice [ 49]. OT-CFM transforms
the speech token sequence into Mel spectrogram, which is then used to generate the final speech with
the HiFi-GAN vocoder [109].
•Hubert. Speech tokens extracted by the pre-trained HuBERT [ 79] are widely used as generation
targets for large language models in the spoken dialogue systems. SpeechGPT [ 243] and Spirit-
LM [ 159] use LLaMA [ 201] to autoregressively predict a sequence of units and are trained with
a HuBERT unit-based HiFi-GAN [ 109] to decode the speech signal from discrete representations.
PSLM [ 155] introduces an additional speech projection layer after the Transformer layers to process
the hidden states, obtaining semantic tokens via the softmax layler. The speech decoder in LLama-
Omni [ 57] operates in a non-autoregressive manner, taking the output hidden states of the large
language model as input to generate a discrete HuBERT unit sequence corresponding to the speech
response. The discrete units can be converted into waveform with an additional unit-based vocoder
[167]. IntrinsicV oice [ 249] introduces Group-Former to enhance the large language model’s capability
in sequence modeling. When the large language model predicts the < speech > token, the global
embedding is passed through a projection layer and delivered, along with a set of learnable queries, to
the group model, which then predicts units. IntrinsicV oice uses HiFi-GAN [ 109], a non-autoregressive
neural vocoder that efficiently generates high-fidelity waveforms, for speech detokenization to reduce
overall latency. Align-SLM [ 130] also uses a HiFiGAN-based [ 109] model to convert discrete units
back into waveforms, utilizing model checkpoints from the textlesslib [103] library.
•Others. USDM [ 107] does not generate speech directly from input speech; instead, it first
transcribes the speech, generates the response text, and then produces corresponding speech token
in an end-to-end pipeline. By inserting text-related tasks between speech input and output, the
model benefits from both pre-trained LLMs and chain-of-thought [ 219] reasoning in the intermediate
modality. Since each stage in the pipeline processes all input and output tokens generated by the
14

previous stage. USDM is more robust to transcription errors and better able to produce contextually
relevant spoken responses compared to a cascaded approach with separate modules. USDM uses
the V oicebox [ 118] architecture to train a unit-to-speech model for reconstructing speech from units.
EMOV A [ 25] generates a response in the form of speech units when given an image or speech input,
which is then converted into an output waveform using the U2S detokenizer. The U2S detokenizer
follows the V AE architecture: it uses a speech unit encoder to convert the predicted speech units
into continuous embeddings, combines these with style embeddings predicted by the large language
model to determine duration, and finally reconstructs the speech waveform through the decoder.
Acoustic. Many spoken dialogue systems choose to directly generate tokens from acoustic represen-
tation models, such as EnCodec [ 43], SpeechTokenizer [ 250], and Mimi [ 44]. These acoustic tokens
are then upsampled into the raw waveform through the frozen codec decoder directly.
•Encodec. LauraGPT [ 50] uses Qwen-1.8B [ 11] to predict speech tokens. When synthesizing
speech, it conditions the predictor not only on the speech tokens predicted by the LLM but also on
text and speech inputs. Such text and speech conditionings allow the model to generate high-quality
speech signals by leveraging the diverse information in prompt and noisy speeches, which is lacked
in the discrete tokens (output from the first quantizer of the Encodec). The predicted speech tokens
and conditioning inputs are delivered together to the codec vocoder. An encoder-only Transformer
models these inputs into dense embeddings, which are then reconstructed into speech by the codec
decoder.
•SNAC. SNAC [ 194] encodes speech into hierarchical tokens, similar to EnCodec [ 43] and
DAC [ 114], by introducing quantization at different time resolutions to form a multi-scale discrete
representation of speech. In this approach, shallow RVQ layers have a lower sampling frequency,
covering a broader time span, while deeper RVQ layers sample at higher frequencies. SNAC
introduces modest enhancements over RVQ-GAN by incorporating residual noise blocks, deep
convolutions, and local window attention. The Mini-Omni [ 223,224] series continues the parallel
generation method introduced by MusicGen[ 40], utilizing SNAC [ 194] as the speech encoder, which
comprises seven complementary token layers. In a single step, it generates eight tokens, including
text, while maintaining a one-step delay between layers. Furthermore, Mini-Omni and Mini-Omni
2 incorporates a batch approach that involves two samples: one requiring both text and speech
responses and the other necessitating a text-only response. By discarding the text token from the
first sample and embedding the output from the second sample into the first, it effectively transfer
the model’s text-based capabilities to speech tasks, significantly enhancing reasoning abilities with
minimal resource overhead.
•SpeechTokenizer. On the output side, SpeechGPT-Gen synthesizes speech tokens using flow
matching[ 132]. Flow matching effectively models the transformation from a simple prior distribution
to complex data distributions, yielding promising results in speech generation. SpeechGPT-Gen
[245] applies flow matching for perceptual modeling, generating speech tokens that align with those
of SpeechTokenizer [ 250]. Specifically, given speech S, semantic representation V1, perceptual
representation V2:8and the complete information representation V1:8=V1+V2:8extracted by
SpeechTokenizer, perceptual modeling refers to predicting the complete representation V1:8given the
prompt speech a and the semantic representation V1. SpeechGPT-Gen synthesizes response speech
by concatenating the output of SpeechGPT [ 243] with the prompt speech and using a flow matching
model.
•Mimi. Mimi [ 44] has eight codebooks at a frame rate of 12.5Hz, which requires 100 autoregressive
steps to generate one second speech. This results in high computational costs and incompatibility with
streaming inference. To address these issues, Moshi [ 44] proposes the RQ-Transformer, comprising
a temporal Transformer and a deep Transformer. The RQ-Transformer breaks down a flattened
sequence of length K·SintoStimesteps for a large temporal Transformer which produces a context
embedding used to condition a smaller depth Transformer over Ksteps. This allows scaling to longer
sequences by increasing Sor to a higher depth by increasing Kthan modeling the flattened sequence
with a single model.
•TiCodec. Ti-Codec [ 178] is a decoupled codec model which can separate the time-varying
and time-invariant information in speech and quantize them separately. Inspired by V ALL-E [ 210],
Freeze-Omni [ 214] uses a token-based speech decoder which contains NAR prefill and AR generate
stage to achieve speech output capabilities. The speech decoder mainly consists of the NAR decoder,
the AR decoder, and the frozen decoder of a codec model [ 178]. Both the NAR decoder and AR

decoder are built upon transformer blocks. The NAR decoder is used to model the semantic features
from the output of LLM, and then the AR decoder generates speech tokens based on the output of
the NAR decoder. Finally, the decoder of the codec model converts the speech tokens into a speech
stream.
3.3 Discussions about Representation used in Spoken Dialogue Systems
3.3.1 Semantic Representation vs. Acoustic Representation
Current dialogue systems typically choose different approaches for the understanding (input) and
generation (output) sides based on task requirements. For example, Spirit-LM [ 159] uses semantic
representations (HuBERT [ 79]) consistently on both ends, while Mini-Omni [ 223] uses semantic
representations (Whisper [ 170]) on the input side and acoustic representations (SNAC [ 194]) on the
output side. Each combination offers unique advantages and trade-offs, and a consensus on a unified
speech representation approach has yet to be reached in practical applications.
We revisited the differences between semantic and acoustic representations, as shown in Table 1.
Benefiting from specific task objectives, models such as Wav2Vec [ 185], HuBERT [ 79], WavLM [ 27],
and Whisper [ 170] focus on extracting semantic information embedded within the spoken content.
This inherent advantage allows speech to be directly mapped into the embedding space of large
language models (LLMs), facilitating alignment with other modalities and fully leveraging the LLM’s
strengths. In contrast, acoustic representations extracted by models like EnCodec [ 43] and DAC
[114] are less conducive to LLM understanding, which is why SpeechTokenizer [ 250] and Mimi [ 44]
opt for semantic distillation. In addition, semantic representations offer higher compression rates.
By configuring various downsampling parameters in convolutional layers, models like HuBERT
and Whisper easily achieve frame rates of 25Hz to 50Hz. Spirit-LM [ 159], for instance, uses 25Hz
HuBERT units, meaning that only 25 tokens are needed to represent one second of speech. In contrast,
acoustic features are designed with compression and reconstruction in mind, where the constraints of
signal transmission make extreme compression and high-quality reconstruction challenging to achieve
simultaneously. Although Mimi [ 44] has achieved a frame rate of 12.5Hz, its use of 8 codebooks
means that autoregressively predicting one second of speech requires 100 steps. Finally, in certain
scenarios, semantic representations hold distinct advantages.
However, we must acknowledge that purely semantic representations fall short in naturalness and
expressiveness, especially in tasks involving emotional expression or complex speech dynamics,
where acoustic representations provide more nuanced information. For instance, HuBERT [ 79]
cannot extract prosodic and stylistic features as effectively as EnCodec [ 43] or Emotion2Vec [ 144].
Notably, using acoustic representations allows for flexible handling of various data types—speech,
audio, music, and sound—making dialogue systems more unified and versatile. Moreover, when
acoustic representations are used as the output of a language model, they can seamlessly connect to
the codec decoder for speech synthesis. In contrast, dialogue systems using semantic features often
require separately trained vocoders [ 159,107] or rely on additional text-to-speech toolkits [ 57]. This
gap is crucial for dialogue systems, as the resulting latency directly impacts the user experience.
Given the unique advantages of semantic and acoustic features across different tasks, future research
may shift toward integrating these features. A valuable perspective is that models like SpeechTok-
enizer [ 250] and Mimi [ 44] have already attempted to distill semantic representations from HuBERT
[79] or WavLM [ 27] into RVQ-1, ensuring a balanced representation of both semantic and acoustic
information in the system. With technological advancements, we look forward to more unified and
refined modeling approaches. A promising direction would be to design new training objectives for
speech tokenizers, exploring both data-driven and objective-driven methods, thus avoiding the need
for additional pre-trained models. As spoken dialogue Systems are still evolving, exploring more
robust hybrid representations is indeed valuable.

3.3.2 Continuous Representation vs. Discrete Representation
There is still no consensus on whether to use continuous or discrete representations in the spoken
dialogue systems. Considerations on the input side mainly depend on the type of representation
model chosen by the system. Some systems [ 223,224,57] use models like HuBERT [ 79] or Whisper
[170] to extract continuous speech representations, which requires adding a speech adapter and an
additional training phase focused on modality alignment. Another systems [ 243,25,44] use models
like EnCodec [ 43] or Mimi [ 44] to extract discrete speech representations, adding speech tokens
directly to the LLM’s vocabulary, thereby shifting the training burden onto the LLM itself. Despite
the different approaches, the key is to enable large language models to effectively understand speech
features. For autoregressive models, using discrete inputs may appear more manageable; however,
whether this truly outperforms continuous inputs in terms of performance remains to be explored.
Language models trained with next-token prediction objectives tend to favor discrete modalities.
Using discrete features on the output side naturally supports simple codec decoders [ 223,224,44,214]
for reconstructing high-fidelity speech, enhancing speech quality and acoustic control while enabling
an end-to-end system. In contrast, continuous features may require additional text-to-speech toolkits
[61] or vocoders [ 57], resulting in a cascaded pipeline and making it difficult to preserve detailed
acoustic information. Another notable advantage of using discrete representations as output is the
ability to quickly feed them into the input of the next dialogue round, as demonstrated in OmniFlatten
[247]. In the field of computer vision, a range of work [ 257,222] has emerged that combines discrete
and continuous representations, aiming to fully integrate these modes without information loss, and
has already achieved success in certain areas. These approaches may provide valuable insights for
the next generation of spoken dialogue systems.
3.3.3 Single-Layer Quantizer vs. Multi-Layer Quantizer
As previously mentioned regarding compression rates, the number of quantizers must be carefully
considered when using the speech codec. Currently, dialogue systems commonly use multi-layer
quantizers, such as those in EnCodec [ 43], SpeechTokenizer [ 250], SNAC [ 194] and Mimi [ 44]. This
inevitably introduces generation latency, as residual vector quantization requires each quantizer’s
input to depend on the output of the previous quantizer. Mini-Omni [ 223] and Mini-Omni 2 [ 224]
adopt an approach similar to MusicGen [ 40], introducing delayed steps to enable parallel generation
across multiple quantizers. Moshi [ 44] proposes splitting the RVQ, allowing the eight VQs to generate
independently in parallel. These strategies help mitigate latency issues to some extent but still fall
short of the efficiency achieved with semantic representations.
Recently, research on single-layer quantizers has shown promising breakthroughs. Models like
WavTokenizer [ 92], Single-Codec [ 120], and BigCodec [ 225] advocate using a single VQ to dis-
cretize speech, achieving competitive results in both reconstruction and generation tasks. Notably,
WavTokenizer [ 92] has already achieved an impressive compression rate of 40Hz. Integrating a
single-layer quantizer with dialogue systems is promising, as it allows for rapid extraction of speech
features on the input side and significantly reduces the burden of autoregressive modeling.
3.3.4 With Text Guidance vs. Without Text Guidance
In practice, researchers have found direct speech-to-speech generation challenging [ 223,224,57]
due to complex mapping relationships, so intermediate texts are often generated to achieve higher
generation quality. Current end-to-end dialogue systems commonly adopt one of two strategies:
one [ 57,249] generates the hidden states corresponding to the text response first, which are then
post-processed to obtain speech tokens; the other [ 223,224,44] generates text and speech tokens
in parallel. These approaches leverage the text modeling capabilities of large language models,
essentially guiding the synthesis of semantically consistent speech by first generating text. However,
this comes at the expense of response speed.
Although directly performing speech-to-speech generation presents challenges such as increased
model complexity and inference difficulty, we believe it remains a promising direction for future
research. One approach is to retrain large spoken language models to adapt to specific speech
representations. However, this faces challenges related to data resources, as large-scale and high-
quality conversational datasets remain scarce. Additionally, this method cannot completely eliminate
text prompts and requires multi-stage training, starting with text-speech pairs to allow the model
17

to progressively acquire conversational capabilities. Another approach could begin with speech
codecs, as demonstrated by SpeechTokenizer and Mimi’s extensive work in semantic distillation.
We envision a novel speech codec that aligns text and speech during the encoding phase, thereby
reducing the generation burden on large language models. By aligning speech representations with
the text representation space earlier in the process, the autoregressive modeling would no longer
require text guidance, giving rise to an entirely new paradigm for conversational systems.
4 Training Paradigm of Spoken Dialogue Model
Existing text-based large language models have demonstrated strong contextual understanding and
reasoning abilities in the field of natural language processing, such as GPT-4 [ 1], Llama 3.1 [ 52],
and Qwen-2 [ 229]. Due to their training on large-scale corpora, these models achieve exceptional
accuracy when handling complex contexts. To further expand the capabilities of large language
models, some research [ 25,33,61,224] has explored enabling them to understand other modalities,
thereby building multimodal interaction abilities. The spoken dialogue model, also known as the
speech-text dialogue model, allows users to interact with LLMs naturally and straightforwardly
through speech. However, the transition from text intelligence to speech intelligence involves two
inherent hurdles: one core issue is the insufficient amount of speech data compared to the massive
datasets used for pre-training text-based large language models. For instance, Llama 3.1 [ 52] uses 800
billion training tokens, and Qwen-2 [ 229] is trained on over 7 trillion tokens, whereas pure speech
pre-training data often amounts to hundreds of thousands or millions of hours. For example, Moshi’s
[44] pre-training speech data comprises 7 million hours, and the amount of labeled speech data is even
smaller, making it difficult to support LLMs in achieving powerful speech intelligence comparable to
text. Another challenge is that speech information density is not as compact as text. Text commonly
uses byte-pair encoding (BPE) [ 62,187] encoding to compress it into a tight token space, whereas the
speech modality includes not only semantic information but also acoustical information, which is less
dense. This undoubtedly increases the difficulty for LLMs to learn. Understanding and generating
the inherent knowledge of the speech modality more effectively is a significant challenge.
Consequently, existing spoken dialogue models aim to build upon text-based LLMs by incorporating
the speech modality into these large language models. [ 243,25,223,44] support speech-in and
speech-out capabilities for LLMs, forming the foundation of basic speech dialogue capabilities. Some
of the latest advanced approaches [ 44,247,204] attempt to transition from traditional turn-based
spoken dialogue systems to full-duplex systems, aiming to simulate the natural spontaneity of human
conversation. While these advancements are promising, achieving low latency and natural interaction
in full-duplex systems remains a significant challenge. Moreover, enhancing LLMs to effectively han-
dle the speech modality—mastering both speech comprehension and generation—while maintaining
robust natural language text processing capabilities, is hindered by the limited size of labeled speech
datasets. These datasets are far smaller compared to the vast amounts of pure text data available,
which risks diminishing the models’ original text processing capabilities. Thus, building a truly end-
to-end conversational model that meets real-world requirements necessitates careful consideration of
model architecture, training paradigms, and training data. Overall, we believe that several key aspects
are crucial in the training paradigm of spoken dialogue models: aligning speech-text modalities to
ensure consistent understanding, designing multi-stage training strategies for gradual adaptation, and
optimizing training structures and inference paradigms for efficient performance.
4.1 Architecture Paradigm about Modal Alignment of Speech and Text
To enable large language models (LLMs) to handle both speech input and output, a significant amount
of prior work [ 180,52,57,223,44] has focused on adapting text-based foundation models into robust
spoken dialogue models. Based on different architectural paradigms, these approaches can be broadly
categorized into five types, as shown in Figure 5.
Text-Output Only Method. These systems [ 33,34,67,228,199,81,41,61] maintain the text-based
LLM’s foundational structure unchanged, using an audio encoder and adaptor to map speech input
into the LLM’s pre-trained text latent space directly. This method of direct embedding alignment,
combined with a multi-task training strategy, equips the LLM with the ability to ’listen,’ thus enabling
it to understand and process speech modality inputs effectively and perform exceptionally well in
various audio understanding tasks. Nevertheless, the output remains text-based, which necessitates the

use of an external text-to-speech (TTS) system [ 21,49] to generate speech output. LTU-AS [ 67] uses
Whisper [ 170] and the Time and Layer-Wise Transformer (TLTR) as its audio encoder, allowing it to
recognize both speech and audio events. Qwen-Audio 1 [ 34] scales up audio-language pre-training to
cover over 30 tasks and various audio types, facilitating universal audio understanding abilities. It
employs a unified encoder for all audio inputs, bridging the gap between audio and textual modalities,
and uses the large language model Qwen-7B [ 11] as its foundational component. Qwen-Audio 2
[33] simplifies the pre-training process by utilizing natural language prompts for different data and
tasks, with DPO [ 171] optimizing the model’s performance in terms of factuality and adherence
to desired behavior. SALMMON [ 199] employs dual auditory encoders: a speech encoder from
the Whisper model and a non-speech BEATs [ 28] audio encoder. The auditory features from these
two encoders are complementary, making them suitable for general audio inputs that contain both
speech and non-speech information. These inputs are then connected to a well-trained LLM using
Q-former style attention to generate responses. VITA [ 61] implements a duplex solution through
two independent modules: one generates text responses to user queries, while the other continuously
monitors environmental input to selectively provide updated interaction content, although it still
requires an external TTS system. All the aforementioned methods frequently overlook paralinguistic
information, including emotion, prosody, and non-verbal elements, rendering them insufficient for
scenarios that involve emotional speech dialogue. ParalinGPT [ 129] utilizes an ASR model to obtain
text and a speech encoder to extract emotion embeddings, thereby more accurately simulating both
the linguistic content and paralinguistic attributes of spoken responses. E-chat [ 228] employs a
Hubert speech encoder [ 79] to extract speech and emotion features, using a connection module to
map these features to the textual space within the LLM decoder. Although these approaches have
explored emotional responses within spoken dialogue systems, they require additional systems to
synthesize speech from text and suffer from high latency, making real-time dialogue challenging to
achieve.
Chain-of-Modality (CoM) Method. This method tokenizes speech into discrete tokens and extends
the LLM’s vocabulary to handle both speech input and output. To address alignment issues between
speech and text modalities, Recent works [ 243,245,157,25] utilize a prompting approach called
Chain-of-Modality (CoM), which first generates response text autoregressively before producing
the corresponding speech. This technique allows the text LLM’s output to guide speech generation,
thereby enhancing the quality of the response content. However, it is not suitable for live interactions,
as the model must complete the entire text response before beginning speech generation, leading to
increased response latency. SpeechGPT [ 243] and SpeechGPT-gen [ 245] employ the SpeechTokenizer
[250] model as a speech token extractor, breaking down speech generation into the prediction of
semantic tokens followed by acoustic tokens. Spectron [ 157] performs speech continuation by
19

predicting spectrograms frame-by-frame, optimizing the LLM with a combination of cross-entropy
loss for text and reconstruction loss for speech frames. EMOV A [ 25], on the other hand, utilizes the
FSPIRAL [ 86] architecture for its speech encoder to capture phonetic and tonal information, which is
then discretized using finite scalar quantization (FSQ) [ 150]. Its speech response procedure is divided
into three primary steps: 1) transcribing user instructions into text, 2) generating textual responses
based on these instructions, and 3) producing style labels and response speech units from the textual
responses. This process enables EMOV A to facilitate emotional speech dialogue.
Interleaving Text and Speech Tokens. Some earlier models [ 180,146] employed supervised training
methods, using specific input and output sequences, and trained on mixed speech-text tasks, including
text-to-speech (TTS), automatic speech recognition (ASR), and speech-to-speech translation. Spirit-
LM [ 159] leverages the temporal alignment between speech and its transcription, continuing training
on a pre-trained text-based LLM using alternating text and speech tokens. This significantly improves
the model’s performance in both speech understanding and generation. However, it employs discrete
Hubert units [ 79] as speech representations, which results in some loss of paralinguistic information.
USDM [ 107] continues pretraining Mistral-7B [ 22] with interleaved speech-text data to capture
multimodal semantics. For dialogue finetuning, it constructs templates using both speech and
transcripts of user input as instruction data.
Parallel Generation of Text and Speech. PSLM [ 155] proposes generating speech and text tokens
in parallel to reduce latency; however, this approach may compromise response quality. Additionally,
this method still relies on speech recognition for input [ 170], which introduces further delay. Llama-
Omni [ 57] introduces a novel streaming speech decoder that can simultaneously generate text
responses and discrete speech unit sequences, significantly reducing latency and meeting real-time
interaction needs. Moshi [ 44] and Mini-Omni [ 223] adopt similar approaches, introducing dual
streams that generate both speech tokens and corresponding text tokens simultaneously on the
assistant side, facilitating the transfer of the pre-trained LLM’s textual capabilities to the speech
modality, enabling the model to directly engage in reasoning through speech. The key difference lies
in how speech-text alignment is handled: Moshi [ 44] uses explicit alignment information to supervise
the model’s learning, while Mini-Omni [ 223] allows the LLM to learn implicit alignment information.
On the input side, Mini-Omni feeds continuous speech embeddings from the Whisper encoder [ 170]
into the LLM, enhancing the model’s ability to understand spoken instructions without requiring text
input. However, inconsistencies between speech input and output introduce additional computational
overhead, increasing latency in multi-turn dialogue scenarios. In contrast, Moshi allows users to input
speech without relying on text, and generates both text and speech tokens in parallel on the assistant
side. Moshi further extends its architecture to model several speech streams in parallel, allowing for
conceptually and practically simple handling of full-duplex dialogues with arbitrary dynamics.
Speech-to-Speech Generation. This approach aims to remove the dependency on intermediate
text, thereby reducing latency and making the system closer to real-time interaction. SyncLLM
[204] achieves real-time full-duplex interaction through time chunking methods, integrating time
information into LLMs to enable synchronous operation with the real-world clock. IntrinsicV oice
[249] utilizes a specific model to generate multiple speech tokens in a single step, effectively reducing
speech token sequences to lengths comparable to text sequences while producing high-quality audio.
Align-SLM [ 130] utilizes a pre-trained self-supervised Hubert model [ 79] with K-means clustering
[74] to convert continuous speech representations into discrete units. It employs LoRA adapter [ 80]
fine-tuning on a pre-trained Twist [ 74] to produce multiple speech continuations from a given prompt
and uses semantic metrics to generate preference data for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
[171]. Experimental results indicate that integrating the preference optimization method significantly
improves the semantic comprehension of the Spoken LLM.
4.2 Multi-stage Training strategy
This section primarily discusses the training process of the Spoken Dialogue Model, building upon
previous work on spoken dialogue systems. Generally, this process consists of four stages: text LLM
pre-training, modality adaptation and alignment post-training, followed by supervised fine-tuning, and
optionally, preference optimization. The primary goal in training most spoken dialogue systems is to
preserve the model’s original capabilities while integrating the speech modality for voice interaction
into the LLM. The diagram of multi-stage training can be referred to in Figure 6.

4.2.1 Text LLM Pre-Training
The goal is to develop a text-intelligent LLM model capable of handling complex contexts and
possessing knowledge reasoning abilities, thus preparing it for integration with speech-intelligent
LLMs. Most spoken dialogue systems utilize pre-trained large language models as foundational
models rather than pre-training with separate text data themselves. A series of approaches [ 243,245,
159,25,57,204] use the LLaMA model and its variants as their foundational language model. On
the other hand, [ 50,223,224,247] employ the Qwen [ 11,229] family of large language models as
their backbone. Meanwhile, Moshi [ 44] employs an RQ-Transformer for hierarchical autoregressive
modeling of speech, utilizing a unique structure that involves pre-training a text-only language
model with datasets from the internet (e.g., Wikipedia12and StackExchange13). The collected data
was filtered using a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline to ensure quality and relevance, which
included deduplication to remove redundant entries, language identification to retain text in the
desired language, and quality filtering to exclude low-quality or irrelevant content based on criteria
such as coherence and completeness. VITA [ 61] utilizes Mixtral 8x7B1 [ 96], a representative LLM
with a sparse mixture of experts (SMoE) architecture, and performs pure-text instruction tuning for
its extended Chinese vocabulary.
4.2.2 Modality Adaptation and Alignment Post-training
This phase explores strategies to adapt text-based large language models (LLMs) for speech modality
input, focusing on aligning text and audio modalities effectively. The primary goal is to enhance the
models’ ability to understand and generate speech by bridging the gap between these two modalities.
Common approaches include multimodal training techniques, leveraging unlabeled speech corpora,
and employing multi-task learning frameworks. These methods typically involve fine-tuning existing
LLMs with speech-related tasks and integrating speech-specific modules, such as speech adaptors
and decoders, to facilitate seamless interaction between text and speech modalities. Different training
tasks for modality adaptation and alignment are shown in Figure 7. Spirit-LM [ 159] continuously
pretrains on text LLM checkpoints using interleaved text and speech tokens to improve the model’s
performance in speech understanding and generation. LLaMA-Omni [ 57] adopts a two-stage training
strategy: the first stage jointly trains a speech adaptor and LLM with speech input and text responses,
while the second stage uses the same dataset to train a streaming speech decoder independently.
Consequently, this LLM primarily possesses the capability for speech input understanding, with

speech generation handled by a separate decoder module. SpeechGPT [ 243], Moshi [ 44], and VITA
[61] utilize unlabeled speech corpora to train models in a next-token prediction task. In the first phase,
VITA focuses on training the audio encoder and connector, while in the second phase, it optimizes
both the connector and the LLM model through multimodal training. Although capable of processing
speech input, it outputs only text. Spectron [ 157] addresses the alignment issue between text and
speech representations by jointly supervising multiple objectives. IntrinsicV oice [ 249] employs a two-
stage training approach, constructing multiple cross-modal tasks from a single dataset to enable the
model to better learn the semantic consistency between speech and text. Mini-Omni [ 223], EMOV A
[25], and OmniFlatten [ 247] adopt similar methodologies, commencing with supervised multi-task
fine-tuning of the text LLM backbone to achieve speech-text modality alignment and develop a
multimodal LLM [ 100,121] using Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Speech (TTS)
tasks. Notably, Mini-Omni divides the training of various modules into three phases: the first phase
utilizes data from speech recognition and synthesis to enhance the model’s abilities in these aspects,
training only the ASR and TTS adapters. The second phase focuses exclusively on enhancing the
model’s text capabilities when given speech inputs, updating only the LLM parameters while freezing
other modules. Through these two training phases, the original language LLM’s capabilities are
maximally preserved, while adapting to speech modality input and output, thereby addressing the
primary modality alignment tasks.
4.2.3 Supervised Fine-tuning or Dialogue Dataset Fine-tuning
During this stage, most models use instruction-following datasets or dialogue data for supervised
fine-tuning of the LLM, enhancing natural conversational abilities. [ 243,245] propose a two-stage
instruction-tuning process that includes cross-modal instruction fine-tuning and chain-of-modality
instruction fine-tuning. Ultimately, the model follows the A-T-T-A method to achieve end-to-end
speech input and output. EMOV A [ 25] employs a similar chain-of-modality concept to construct
instruction-tuning datasets, empowering it to respond accurately to speech instructions. Moshi [44],
Mini-Omni [ 223], OmniFlatten [ 247], and SyncLLM [ 204] utilize spoken dialogue datasets for
fine-tuning, endowing the models with conversational interaction capabilities. Remarkably, Moshi
constructs a more natural and realistic dialogue dataset that incorporates elements such as noise and
overlap, enabling the model to learn authentic multi-stream interactions. OmniFlatten fine-tunes the
speech-text LLM using interleaved and serialized dialogues across three stages to progressively train
the model in acquiring half-duplex and full-duplex communication capabilities. Similarly, SyncLLM
employs a three-stage training procedure that predominantly uses synthetic spoken dialogue data
along with a relatively small amount of real-world spoken dialogue data to develop a full-duplex
voice agent.
4.2.4 Preference Optimization and Reinforcement Learning
The research on leveraging preference optimization to align a spoken dialogue model with human
preferences is virtually absent. Recently, [ 5,244,23] adopted preference optimization for Text-to-
Speech (TTS) models to align speech synthesis quality with human preferences but not for spoken
22

dialogue models. Align-SLM [ 130] pioneers the integration of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
[171] in textless Spoken Language Models (SLMs) to enhance semantic understanding. It transforms
continuous speech into discrete units using a pre-trained Hubert model and K-means clustering. LoRA
fine-tuning on a Spoken LLM generates multiple speech continuations from prompts. Semantic
metrics create preference data offline, making DPO training efficient and stable, eliminating the need
for an external reward model. Coupled with curriculum learning [ 15], Align-SLM progressively
refines preference data selection, optimizing semantic feedback, and improving SLM performance.
4.3 Training Frameworks and Generation Strategies
Recent advanced methods in spoken dialogue models employ a variety of innovative techniques to
achieve more natural speech output and lower latency. In this part, we explore various approaches
that exemplify these advancements:
•LLama-Omni. LLama-Omni [ 57] adds a streaming speech decoder that operates after the LLM.
This decoder runs in a non-autoregressive manner, taking the output hidden states from the LLM
as input and generating the discrete unit sequence corresponding to the speech response. To model
the variable-length mapping between input and output, LLama-Omni employs an upsample factor,
denoted as λ, along with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss [ 69]. This ensures that the
model can generate speech responses simultaneously with text responses. Additionally, a predefined
chunk size is set to further enable vocoder streaming synthesis of speech waveforms, facilitating
real-time interaction and reducing latency.
•Mini-Omni. Mini-Omni [ 223] selects SNAC [ 194], a music-grade encoder, to discretize one
second of audio into hundreds of tokens, which significantly increases the burden on the LLM for
modeling speech tokens. Delay Pattern language model decoding strategies are often applied in
modeling multiple parallel streams of acoustic tokens in speech tasks like MusicGen [ 40], V oiceCraft
[164], and Parler-TTS [ 141]. Compared with traditional sequential step decoding, this strategy can
effectively reduce the time steps required for LLM decoding and generating speech tokens. Inspired
by this, Mini-Omni innovatively applies text-instructed delayed parallel generation to address the
issue of long SNAC codebook sequences, simultaneously producing audio and text tokens. This
effectively leverages and preserves the original capabilities of the language model. Moreover, Mini-
Omni proposes a Batch Parallel Decoding method. Specifically, it generates two samples in parallel
for a single input: the first predicts text tokens, and the second predicts both text and speech tokens
simultaneously. The text output from the first sample is embedded into the corresponding positions
of the second sample, while the second sample’s text output is discarded. This further enhances the
model’s reasoning capabilities during dialogue, maximizing the transfer of its text-based abilities.
•IntrinsicVoice. IntrinsicV oice [ 249] introduces a speech encoder and a streaming vocoder
for the tokenization and detokenization of speech, and a GroupFormer for modeling speech and
text sequences. This architecture integrates a large language model (LLM) with a GroupModel.
Specifically, it uses a pre-trained HuBERT encoder [ 79] and its corresponding KMeans quantizer
[74] to process speech inputs into discrete units. These units are organized into a grouped token
sequence through a group partition operation. The grouped tokens are then passed through an
embedding layer and adaptor module to map these embeddings into the LLM’s embedding space.
The context embeddings output by the LLM are processed through a linear layer and concatenated
with a specified number of learnable queries. This input is fed into a smaller non-autoregressive
transformer encoder model, dubbed the "GroupModel," to predict a group of speech tokens in one
step. The introduction of GroupFormer effectively improves the model’s ability to handle sequences
within a group, mitigates the modality gap between speech and text, accelerates inference speed, and
alleviates issues associated with long-sequence modeling.
•Moshi. Moshi [ 44] introduces a mini codec model with 8 codebooks at a frame rate of 12.5
Hz for speech representation, where one second corresponds to 100 speech tokens. It adopts an
RQ-Transformer consisting of a Temporal Transformer and a smaller Depth Transformer as the
backbone network for the LLM, hierarchically modeling multi-codebook audio tokens. Similar
architectures have appeared in prior research, such as UniAudio [ 233] and Megabyte [ 238]. The
Depth Transformer models sub-sequence tokens conditioned on temporal context predicted by the
Temporal Transformer. Given the smaller size of the Depth Transformer, sub-sequence generation
can almost be viewed as parallel generation. This allows the model to scale to longer sequences by
extending the temporal modeling capacity of the Temporal Transformer or to achieve greater depth
23

by enhancing the hierarchical modeling capabilities of the Depth Transformer, rather than modeling
the flattened sequence with a single model.
•SyncLLM. SyncLLM [ 204] employs an auto-regressive transformer decoder for full-duplex
dialogue, integrating time synchronization to align speech units with the real-world clock. It predicts
interleaved speech tokens for both dialogue partners, maintaining timing with speaker tags. The model
is trained on deduplicated HuBERT token sequences to enhance semantic fidelity while managing
latency by anticipating user responses. Interpolation reconstructs token sequences to fit expected
structures, facilitating seamless speech synthesis.
Text-guided generation. Some end-to-end methods like [ 243,245,157,25] use chain-of-thought
reasoning, which allows guiding speech generation with the output of an underlying text LLM.
However, this is fundamentally incompatible with live interactions, as the model needs to produce an
entire answer as text before it starts speaking. Later methods [ 57,223,44] can accept user speech
input and simultaneously output speech and text, ensuring high-quality responses while significantly
reducing latency. Lama-Omni [ 57] utilizes a streaming decoder to generate text and speech tokens in
parallel. Mini-Omni [ 223] is restructured to transfer language reasoning abilities to streaming audio
output through a text-audio parallel decoding approach. Moshi [ 44] details a novel feature, the Inner
Monologue, which consists of joint modeling of the textual and speech modalities on the system side
to improve the quality of interactions.
W/o text-guided generation. Other methods achieve speech-to-speech generation without relying on
text stream generation. IntrinsicV oice [ 249] introduces a novel GroupModel that predicts a group of
speech tokens in one step based on global context embeddings. SyncLLM [ 204] predicts interleaved
chunks of token sequences at each time step, allowing the model to handle all conversational cues
such as backchannels, overlaps, interruptions, etc.
4.4 Discussions about Training Paradigm in Spoken Dialogue Models
4.4.1 Text and Speech Modality Alignment
In spoken dialogue systems, the alignment between speech and text modalities is a crucial stage. To
preserve the textual intelligence of large language models (LLMs) as much as possible, nearly all
current methodologies [ 243,155,57,223,224,44,247] incorporate a post-training phase utilizing
speech-text paired data when developing spoken dialogue models. This may involve either expanding
the vocabulary to treat speech tokens as an extension of the original vocabulary or using speech
adaptors to map speech embeddings to the original text latent space of the LLM, and designing
multi-task training objectives to achieve alignment between text and speech modalities. For example,
data from speech recognition and speech synthesis can be used to train the model’s speech recognition
and synthesis capabilities. Although this is an effective strategy, its implementation can still lead to a
certain degree of catastrophic forgetting in LLMs due to the large volume of pre-trained text corpora
and the imbalance with paired speech-text data, which can harm the model’s text-based capabilities.
Therefore, precise parameter design and customized optimization strategies are needed to mitigate
this issue as much as possible, as demonstrated by approaches like Moshi [44].
This raises a consideration: during the training phase of spoken dialogue models, is it feasible to
directly utilize speech data for adaptation to text-based LLMs, thereby eliminating the necessity for
speech-text paired data? This is because unlabeled speech data is abundant and easily accessible,
making it convenient and beneficial for training the speech intelligence of LLMs. This approach
would require us to obtain a pre-aligned speech representation with the text modality. Perhaps we
can consider further exploration and experimentation in the speech tokenizer component, such as
directly mapping the semantic discrete units of speech onto the text token space to achieve enforced
alignment.
4.4.2 Different Temporal Alignment Methods in Spoken Dialogue Models
In speech and text modalities, there is often a significant mismatch in sequence lengths. Even when
some speech tokenizers [ 92,120] employ extreme sequence compression methods, a length gap
remains between the two. Temporal alignment information between speech and text has been explored
in tasks like Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) as demonstrated by
models such as Whisper [ 170], FastSpeech [ 177], and VITS [ 108]. Recently, some spoken dialogue
systems have utilized temporal alignment information to enhance model performance, yielding
24

promising results. For instance, Spirit-LM [ 159] uses interleaving text and speech tokens for
continual pre-training on the LLaMA base model, significantly boosting the model’s performance in
speech understanding and generation. Experimental visualizations demonstrate that the similarity
between text and speech features is notably higher in models trained with interleaved token sequences
compared to those trained without this approach. This indicates that providing the model with explicit
fine-grained temporal alignment information can effectively enhance modality alignment and improve
the performance of LLMs.
Mini-Omni [ 223] achieves parallel generation of text and speech by padding text tokens to match the
length of speech tokens, allowing the LLM to implicitly learn the alignment information between
speech and text tokens. This can be viewed as a form of sentence-level temporal alignment infor-
mation, a method also utilized in recent speech synthesis work [ 30]. Moshi [ 44], on the other hand,
uses word-level speech-text temporal alignment information and special marker tokens to achieve
similar parallel generation capabilities. The difference lies in that Mini-Omni fully allows the LLM
to implicitly learn the alignment, whereas Moshi provides word-level alignment priors first, and then
lets the model learn finer-grained alignments.
Exploring the impact of introducing different levels of temporal alignment priors on the training
effectiveness of spoken dialogue models, such as sentence-level, word-level, or phoneme-level, is
an intriguing area of research. Understanding how these various alignment strategies affect model
performance can guide the development of more efficient and accurate systems. For instance, sentence-
level alignment might offer a broader contextual understanding, while word-level or phoneme-level
alignments could provide more detailed synchronization between speech and text, potentially leading
to improvements in nuanced tasks like speech synthesis and understanding.
4.4.3 Reinforcement Learning (RL) in Spoken Dialogue Models
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven to be an effective learning paradigm in text and image
processing [ 186,197,205]. Recent research has shown that Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
[171] can be extended to music and speech generation [ 36,244]. MusicRL [ 36] uses Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to improve music generation by fine-tuning a pretrained
model for better text adherence and audio quality. By collecting extensive human feedback, MusicRL
creates a more refined and subjective music generation system. Seed-TTS [ 5] explores RL methods,
comparing external reward models like REINFORCE with simpler methods like DPO. The study
highlights using REINFORCE to enhance speaker similarity and emotion controllability in the Seed-
TTS system. Qwen2-Audio [ 33] uses DPO to align with human preferences by optimizing responses
based on human-annotated data. This enhances its ability to follow audio instructions accurately
and intelligently respond to complex audio inputs, improving its performance in audio-centric tasks.
However, in the dialogue system field, reinforcement learning techniques based on human feedback
[83] are rarely applied. Considering the diversity of inputs and outputs in large language models,
exploring the incorporation of reinforcement learning strategies such as Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO) [ 186] can be beneficial. Additionally, considering the performance metrics for evaluating
spoken dialogue systems, designing targeted reinforcement learning strategies and feedback functions
to enhance different objectives is also a direction worth exploring.
5 Streaming, Duplex, and Interaction
Streaming, full-duplex technology, and interactions, are crucial elements for enhancing the interactive
capabilities of spoken dialogue models because they directly impact the system’s responsiveness,
the fluidity of natural interaction, and its ability to handle complex interactions.Unlike text language
models, spoken dialogue models require real-time processing of user input. Streaming allows
the system to instantly acquire and process speech data; full-duplex technology enables both the
system and user to speak simultaneously, enhancing the naturalness of interaction; and handling of
interactions provides the model with the ability to recognize and adapt to various conversational
contexts, making the dialogue more intelligent and realistic. Building on early explorations, GPT-4o’s
advanced spoken dialogue capabilities have ignited a surge of research interest. With real-time voice
processing and natural conversational interaction, these models offer users a seamless and efficient
communication experience. However, achieving these capabilities requires deep research into model
architecture, data collection, system design, and training methods. The model needs to be carefully
designed and optimized in terms of real-time performance, stability, and response speed. At the
25

same time, duplex technology is an indispensable key implementation, which ensures that the voice
model has both "ears" and "mouths". Next, we will first discuss the streaming processing method
in Section 5.1, then introduce the key technologies of duplex communication and explains how to
handle interactation to improve user experience in Section 5.2.
5.1 Streaming Spoken Dialogue Models
The core of streaming speech models lies in their "real-time" and "continuous" capabilities, meaning
they can process input and generate output simultaneously without waiting for complete input. This
includes two main aspects:
•Streaming Understanding. The model can process audio input as the user speaks, without needing
to wait for the user to finish entirely, allowing it to align more naturally with the flow of conversation.
•Streaming Generation. This concept refers to the model’s ability to generate output without
waiting for all intermediate hidden states. Instead, it can produce output progressively as processing
occurs, which improves responsiveness and allows for smoother, more efficient interactions.
These streaming capabilities allow the model to perform more fluidly in real-time interactions,
providing a seamless communication experience for users. We will explore streaming techniques in
both end-to-end and cascaded spoken dialogue models, discussing the implementation methods of
streaming in each system and highlighting their similarities and differences.
5.1.1 Streaming End-to-End Spoken Dialogue Models
End-to-end streaming spoken dialogue models often leverage the knowledge of pre-trained text
language models alongside an audio tokenizer, employing an tokenizer-detokenizer architecture to
process and output audio signals. Based on the concepts of streaming input and output discussed
above, end-to-end models also require specific design considerations to enable streaming capabilities.
These designs center around the model’s input and output handling and can be distilled into three
core techniques: causal convolution, causal attention mechanisms, and queue management.
Causal Convolution. Causal Convolution [ 12] is a specialized form of convolution widely used in
time-series processing, especially suitable for streaming speech models. The key feature of causal
convolution is that the current output depends only on the current and past inputs, without being
influenced by future inputs, thereby strictly respecting temporal order. Unlike regular convolution,
causal convolution achieves this by "shifting" the convolution kernel to avoid accessing future
information. In a one-dimensional time series, if the convolution kernel size is k, a standard
convolution would use data from (t−k/2)to(t+k/2)at the current time step t. Causal convolution,
however, pads the input on the left with k−1zeros so that the kernel only uses data from t−k+ 1
tot, aligning the kernel to only consider current and past inputs. This padding ensures that each
layer’s output depends solely on current and prior information, maintaining causality. To further
expand the model’s receptive field while preserving causality, dilated causal convolution can be
used. This technique introduces gaps within the kernel by inserting zeros between weights, effectively
expanding the convolution’s range. This allows the model to capture longer dependencies in the
data without increasing latency, which is particularly useful for streaming applications. In streaming
spoken dialogue models, causal convolution plays a critical role in:
•Ensuring real-time processing. Causal convolution allows the model to compute outputs without
accessing future frames, enabling real-time processing by generating outputs as input is received,
which is essential for streaming.
•Reducing latency. By not requiring future input data, causal convolution significantly lowers the
latency in speech models, making it more suitable for real-time interaction applications, such as voice
assistants and live translation.
Causal Attention. Causal Attention is a specialized form of the attention mechanism designed to
ensure that each position in a sequence can only attend to previous positions, thus preserving the
temporal order crucial for streaming models. This approach ensures that the model’s current output
depends only on past and present information, preventing any “leakage” of future information, which
is essential for real-time processing tasks. In causal attention, the attention mask is typically used
to achieve causality. By applying a mask that blocks connections to future time steps, the model
restricts each token’s receptive field to only the tokens before it. Specifically, a lower triangular mask
26

is applied to the attention matrix, setting values to negative infinity for positions corresponding to
future tokens. This masking technique ensures that the model’s predictions for each time step only
consider current and past inputs, thereby adhering to a strict causal structure. In streaming speech
models, causal attention plays a significant role in enabling real-time interaction. Unlike standard
attention, which requires access to the entire sequence, causal attention can operate incrementally. As
new inputs are processed, the model can generate outputs without waiting for future context.
Queue Management [ 221].Audio streams are typically split into frames, then processed in sequence
via a queue management system that ensures real-time, orderly processing.
Some end-to-end models, such as Llama-Omni[ 57], Mini-Omni[ 223] and Mini-Omni2[ 224], employ
non-streaming ASR model Whisper as an audio encoder components. These models have made
improvements on the output side to reduce latency.
•Mini-Omni. Mini-Omni use a generation strategy delayed parallel decoding is a that layer-by-
layer delays during audio token generation. This allows the model to generate text and multiple audio
tokens simultaneously at each step, accelerating streaming audio generation and ensuring low-latency
real-time output.
•Llama-Omni. Llama-Omni incorporates a non-autoregressive streaming speech decoder that
leverages connectionist temporal classification (CTC) to directly generate a sequence of discrete
audio tokens as the response.
•Intrinsicvoice. [ 249]Intrinsicvoice introduced GroupFormer module to group speech tokens,
reducing the length of speech sequences to match that of text sequences. This approach accelerates
inference, alleviates the challenges of long-sequence modeling, and effectively narrows the gap
between speech and text modalities.We think they cannot be considered fully streaming because they
are not designed to be streaming on the input side.
•Moshi. [ 44]In contrast, Moshi references the architecture of SpeechTokenizer to train a streaming
codec from scratch, serving as the audio tokenizer-detokenizer. The entire model, including the codec,
transformer, and attention mechanism, is built on a causal structure.
•OmniFlatten. [ 247]OmniFlatten proposes chunk-based processing of text and speech along
with gradual learning techniques and data handling to reduce turn-taking delays, such as response
delays when users finish speaking or interrupt the system. These models have achieved true streaming
capabilities and established a foundation for diverse, bidirectional interactions.
5.1.2 Streaming Cascaded Spoken Dialogue Models
Consistent with the above, ensuring streaming capability in a model relies on designing both input
and output for streaming. Due to its cascaded nature, a cascaded model typically relies on external
streaming ASR and TTS components, placing the streaming responsibility on these ASR and TTS
modules.
In [212], comparative studies were conducted on the streaming ASR model U2++ Conformer [220],
streaming TTS model XTTS-v2 [21], non-streaming ASR Whisper , and non-streaming TTS
VITS [110]. The combination of streaming components achieved the lowest latency and significantly
contributed to interactive interruption capabilities.
5.2 Duplex Technology and Interaction
5.2.1 Duplex Technology
The term Duplex originates from the field of communications, used to describe interaction modes
between two parties in data transmission. Depending on the type of communication, duplex is divided
into half-duplex and full-duplex.
With the development of audio processing and generation technology , the concept of duplex has been
introduced to speech systems, especially within the context of speech language models. Here, duplex
doesn’t just refer to signal transmission but emphasizes the synchronization and natural interaction
in human-computer dialogue. Specifically, within model architecture, it means that the model must
retain its ability to perceive external input even while generating a response—essentially, the ability
to listen while speaking.
27

Simplex. In simplex communication, data flows in only one direction. The speaker can send data,
while the listener can only receive it. As shown in Figure 8a, the robot continuously transmits
audio, while the user has no ability to respond. This fixed-direction, one-way communication has the
limitation of lacking interactivity.
Half-Duplex. In half-duplex communication, data flows in both directions but not simultaneously.
The two parties must take turns speaking and listening. As illustrated in Figure 8b, the user speaks
first, followed by a response delay during which the robot "thinks" before replying. The robot’s
response occurs only after the user has finished speaking, and vice versa. This turn-taking method
is similar to using a walkie-talkie, where each party can only transmit after the other has finished,
limiting efficiency.Half-duplex is a common mode in early voice interaction systems. In a typical
half-duplex interaction, there are noticeable pauses in the conversation; the user and the system
cannot “speak” simultaneously, making the conversation feel less smooth, much like communication
through a walkie-talkie. For example, voice assistants like Siri use wake words or button presses to
trigger the dialogue and require the speaker to finish a complete sentence before responding. These
systems typically adopt an ASR-LM-TTS cascaded structure and are often constrained by cascade
delays and the turn-based nature of text language models. Although this interaction method is simple
and easy to implement, it can feel rigid and disjointed in natural conversational settings, with notable
latency. It is designed more for command execution rather than interactive communication.
Full-Duplex. Full-duplex communication allows both parties to send and receive data simultane-
ously [ 143]. Figure 8c shows the user and robot engaging in overlapping, real-time interaction, where
backchannels and interruptions are possible. This mode enables a natural, two-way conversation,
where both the user and robot can speak, respond, and even interrupt each other as needed, much like a
phone call.In dialogue systems, full-duplex means that the system and user can speak simultaneously
and interrupt each other, making it closer to natural conversation in real life. Full-duplex large voice
models allow the system not only to listen and understand the user while they speak but also to
interrupt at appropriate moments or respond with backchannel cues. Moreover, the system can detect
the user’s intent to interrupt and pause itself accordingly, maintaining a smooth flow in the interaction.
(a) Simplex: One-way communication, and the direction is fixed.
(b) Half-duplex: Two-way communication, but not simultaneously.
(c) Full-duplex: Two-way communication, simultaneously.
Figure 8: The illustration of Simplex, Half-Duplex, and Full-Duplex.
The ultimate goal of a spoken dialogue moded is to make the user feel as though they are conversing
with a real human friend. Clearly, full-duplex technology is essential for achieving natural voice dia-
logue systems, enabling the system to send and receive audio signals simultaneously, thus facilitating
28

real-time interaction. Unlike text-based models, it doesn’t “cover its ears” while speaking. Users and
intelligent agents can interrupt each other while listening or express their attitude through non-verbal
signals, such as interjections or laughter. The challenges in realizing this lie in ensuring conversational
fluidity, seamless turn-taking, and precise timing of interactions. Developing a full-duplex system
that can both generate and receive voice signals in complex interactive scenarios remains a key focus
in academic and industrial research.
5.2.2 Interaction
Now that we understand duplex technology, we can further explore duplex spoken dialogue model.
We start with some concept.Turn-taking is the core concept in duplex dialogue. It refers to the process
in which speakers take turns speaking in an orderly manner during a conversation, forming a pattern
of turn-taking. Over the past few decades and has been extensively studied across fields such as
linguistics, phonetics, and sociology. Some research [174, 181]uses a non-deterministic finite-state
machine with six states to describe the turn-taking behavior between the system and the user in a
spoken dialogue system (SDS). It outlines all possible states of turn-taking within an SDS, defining
the objective of turn-taking as minimizing mutual silence or overlap between interlocutors, thereby
improving communication efficiency. Turn-taking encompasses three fundamental concepts:
•Turn-taking cues [53,54]. These include voice, rhythm, breathing, gaze, or gestures. Agents can
use these cues to determine whether to take a turn from the user or to relinquish the turn.
•Turn-end detection or prediction. The distinction between detection [ 73,116] and prediction [ 115,
55] lies in that detection determines whether the agent should take a turn at the current moment,
whereas prediction decides when the turn-taking should occur in the future.
•Overlap. This mainly involves two situations. When the user and agent’s voices overlap, if the
user intends to take the turn from the agent, this behavior is defined as an interruption [104,147]. If
the user has no intention of taking the turn, this behavior is considered backchannel [72] or a listener
response, such as "uh-huh," "right."
Through these concepts, we can better understand turn-taking behavior in duplex dialogues. In sum-
mary, our interactions with voice dialogue systems can be categorized as interruptions ,backchannels ,
andnormal turn exchanges .
The earliest full-duplex systems used a simple V oice Activity Detection (V AD) component to model
whether the user intended to interrupt. However, this approach is inadequate for handling backchannel
interaction forms, leading to frequent interruptions and introducing considerable delays.
We can briefly categorize the exploration of interactions into cascaded systems and end-to-end
systems based on duplex technology. Regardless of the system type, the critical core idea is that
the system must continuously track external information in real-time, analyze it, and determine the
model’s operational state accordingly. An interactive voice system must meet two requirements: 1)
The ability to accept external information in real-time at any moment. 2) The ability to respond to
this information accurately. This includes:
•Detecting User Interactions. When the user tries to interject or provide new information, the
system can recognize this intent and immediately stop its output to allow the user to speak.
•Backchanneling During User Speech. While the user is speaking, the system can provide brief
acknowledgments like "uh-huh" or "I see" to indicate active listening, which encourages the user to
continue.
•Quickly Responding After User Completion. When the user finishes speaking, the system
can promptly recognize this cue and respond without unnecessary delays, maintaining a smooth
conversational flow.
•Handling Pauses in User Speech. When the user briefly pauses, the system can interpret this as a
moment of thought rather than an invitation to respond, thus avoiding premature interruptions and
preserving the natural flow.
•Interrupting the User When Necessary. In situations where the system detects critical information,
it can choose to interrupt the user to provide immediate feedback. For example, if the user is speaking
29

but the system needs to alert them to an error, it can intervene in real-time to ensure effective
communication.
Cascaded Systems. To enable interactive functionality, cascaded spoken dialogue models typically
require explicit modeling of dialogue turns. As the core, the large language model needs effective
context and turn management. Next, we introduce several representative works on interaction in
cascaded systems.
•Duplex Conversation. In [131], three core modules are proposed to achieve smooth full-duplex
dialogue: user state detection, response signal selection, and interruption detection. The user state
detection module not only focuses on traditional turn-end detection but also identifies whether the user
intends to switch turns, continue speaking, or hesitates during their speech. To achieve this, the system
uses a multimodal model, taking audio and text as inputs, and incorporates features such as speech
rhythm, pitch, and pauses for more accurate assessment of the user’s state, determining whether to
respond immediately or wait longer. The response signal selection module inserts small backchannel
cues (such as "uh-huh" or "right") at appropriate times to simulate natural human conversation.
By analyzing a large volume of real dialogues, this module extracts and trains suitable response
signals for various conversation scenarios. Using multi-label classification, the system selects the
optimal response for each dialogue context, significantly reducing user waiting time and enhancing
conversation flow. The interruption detection module flexibly responds to user interruptions. Unlike
traditional rule-based detection methods, this system builds an end-to-end detection model with
multimodal input (audio and text) that not only identifies genuine user interruptions but also avoids
misinterpreting background noise or unintended voice signals as interruptions.
•Outbound Agent System. [99] proposed a full-duplex dialogue scheme for outbound systems,
focusing on the issues of conversational fluidity and timing of interaction in speech dialogue. This
scheme uses semantic analysis to determine whether the user truly intends to interrupt the system and
can handle disjointed expressions when users mention named entities. The core of this system is a full-
duplex interaction finite-state machine (FSM), which retrieves text snippets from ASR results every
300 milliseconds to decide whether to interrupt. Through continuous semantic analysis of user speech,
the interruption model identifies meaningful user interruptions and avoids frequent interruptions
caused by brief, meaningless responses (like "uh-huh"). The model employs a pre-trained BERT-
based text classifier and utilizes streaming input, ensuring that the system can process and analyze user
speech in real-time as it is received. Additionally, the system includes a Discontinuous Expression
module to handle user pauses when mentioning named entities. Specifically, when users hesitate over
entities (such as numbers, locations, or company names), V AD may erroneously detect turn-end.
The advent of Large Language Models has significantly advanced generative AI development. Models
like ChatGPT demonstrate strong capabilities in semantic understanding and logical reasoning,
offering a simplified method to integrate various dialogue components into a unified framework, which
may simplify SDS construction. GPT-4o represents a milestone for dialogue systems, showcasing
a nearly human-like conversational voice model. Its flexible interaction style and interruption
mechanisms make human-computer interaction more natural and fluid. However, as a commercial
model, its training data and implementation details remain proprietary, making replication challenging.
•Full-duplex LLM. [212] proposed a full-duplex spoken dialogue models based on LLMs, enabling
simultaneous reception and transmission of voice signals through a perception module, an action
module, and a neural finite-state machine (FSM). The perception module uses a streaming ASR
model, capturing and processing user speech in real-time with 640-millisecond intervals per time step,
converting it into token inputs for the LLM. The action module, utilizing a streaming TTS model,
instantly converts the LLM-generated text into audio output and can pause or resume playback as
needed, ensuring the system can generate audio while receiving user input. At the core is the neural
FSM, allowing the LLM to switch between "speaking" and "listening" states. Controlled by FSM
signals, the system can dynamically decide to continue speaking, listen, or interrupt based on the
dialogue context. Experimental results show that Wang et al.’s full-duplex streaming system reduces
response latency by threefold, achieves a response time within 500 milliseconds in over 50% of
dialogues, and handles user interruptions at a rate of 96.7%, with an interruption accuracy of 54.7%.
•VITA. VITA is an open-source multimodal large language model which aimed at enhancing
multimodal interaction experiences. VITA can process multiple modalities, such as video, image,
text, and audio, and achieves fluid human-computer interaction through a new duplex architecture
involving two simultaneously operating models: one for generating responses to user queries, and
30

another for continuously monitoring environmental inputs. When a new user query is detected,
the generation model pauses, and the monitoring model processes the new query and generates an
updated response. This setup enables VITA to support audio interruption, allowing users to ask
new questions during system generation, with the system immediately pausing the current response
to handle new input. VITA’s perception abilities are achieved through multimodal alignment and
instruction fine-tuning, enabling it to switch automatically between different inputs. Additionally,
VITA employs state tokens to distinguish user input types, such as query audio, background noise, and
text input, facilitating wake-free interaction. VITA’s enhanced listening module prevents unnecessary
user feedback from interrupting system responses, improving robustness.
•CleanS2S. [160] This model employs a structured pipeline to enable responsive and flexible
interactions in a spoken dialogue setting. Designed to facilitate seamless turn-taking and interruption
handling, the model consists of several interconnected modules working in a coordinated sequence to
optimize user experience. Starting with user input, the system uses a V oice Activity Detection (V AD)
module to continuously monitor for incoming audio signals. As soon as a user starts speaking, V AD
captures the input and immediately initiates processing by sending the audio data to the Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) module. This quick detection and response setup allows the system
to react to user input without delay. Once ASR transcribes the audio into text, the transcription is
passed to the Large Language Model (LLM), which generates a relevant response based on the user’s
query. Meanwhile, the model is designed to be interruption-aware. During response generation,
if V AD detects a new user input (indicating an interruption or a follow-up query), the system can
promptly adjust its processing flow. In this case, the LLM temporarily pauses its current task,
allowing ASR to transcribe the new input, which the LLM then uses to generate an updated response.
This interruption capability is achieved through the model’s layered processing design, allowing
for adaptive turn-taking that feels natural and responsive. The Text-to-Speech (TTS) module then
converts the generated text response into audio, which is transmitted to the user via WebSocket.
To further support interruption handling, TTS breaks down lengthy responses into smaller audio
segments that are sent progressively. This segmentation allows the system to stop audio output
instantly if an interruption occurs, switching to the new input without delay. Each segment is prepared
and sent only after a brief V AD check, ensuring that the system is ready to pause and handle new input
at any time. This interconnected processing chain—V AD detecting input, ASR transcribing, LLM
generating responses, and TTS outputting segmented audio—creates a duplex interaction framework
that balances response generation and user-driven interruptions. By seamlessly coordinating these
components, the model provides a fluid, real-time dialogue experience that adapts to user interactions
dynamically.
End-to-End Systems. In contrast, end-to-end spoken dialogue models do not require explicit
modeling of dialogue turns; instead, they learn interaction modeling directly from training data. Next,
we introduce several representative works on interaction in end-to-end systems.
•dGSLM. In end-to-end systems, the introduction of the dGSLM model marks a significant
milestone in full-duplex technology development. Within the dGSLM framework, duplex technology
is effectively implemented. This model demonstrates how to capture complex interactions within
dialogues directly from raw audio data through generative spoken dialogue modeling, without relying
on text. The core innovation of dGSLM is the dual-tower Transformer architecture, called the
Dialogue Transformer Language Model (DLM), which uses a cross-attention mechanism to enable
the system to process two parallel audio channels simultaneously. Through this architecture, the
model not only independently generates speech for each channel but also shares information between
channels using cross-attention, effectively modeling silences and interaction events. It leverages the
HuBERT encoder and HiFi-GAN decoder, combined with the dual-tower DLM, and is trained on
2,000 hours of dual-channel telephone conversation audio (Fisher dataset), where each speaker in a
conversation is allocated an independent audio track. The dGSLM model transforms the audio on
both channels into discrete tokens using HuBERT, and the DLM model autoregressively predicts the
next audio token and its duration. Finally, the HiFi-GAN[ 109] decoder reconstructs the audio for
both channels. This approach differs significantly from traditional text-dependent spoken dialogue
models, with a particular emphasis on modeling turn-taking and backchanneling capabilities. This
capability gives dGSLM a notable advantage in duplex voice interaction, better mimicking the natural
dynamics of human conversation. Through its duplex model design, dGSLM represents an essential
step forward in interactive capabilities and provides a foundation for further advancements.
31

•Moshi. As a novel full-duplex architecture, Moshi incorporates a rich array of design concepts.
Unlike dGSLM, Moshi does not abandon the language model’s ability in text dialogue. Moshi’s
architecture is based on the Helium language model and Mimi neural audio codec, both trained from
scratch. Helium, as a large pre-trained text language model, provides strong reasoning capabilities,
while Mimi handles audio signal encoding and decoding. To achieve real-time interaction, Moshi is
designed as a multi-stream architecture, simultaneously processing "user" and "moshi" audio streams
without explicitly modeling speaker turns. Moshi also introduces the "Inner Monologue" method
within the "moshi" audio stream, a process that jointly models text and audio tokens during training
and inference. This approach allows the model to fully utilize textual knowledge while maintaining
speech-to-speech system characteristics, significantly enhancing generation quality. Mimi, a neural
audio codec integrating semantic and acoustic information through residual vector quantization and
knowledge distillation, captures high-quality user input audio and Moshi’s output voice efficiently. To
jointly model Moshi and user audio streams alongside Moshi’s text tokens, Depth Transformer with
streaming inference capabilities is employed. The Mimi encoder and decoder combine convolutional
and Transformer layers, with causal convolutions, allowing for streaming operation. Moshi is pre-
trained on unsupervised audio data to handle speech scenarios and then fine-tuned on the Fisher
dataset to address overlapping speech and interruptions. Finally, the system is further optimized on a
custom instruction-tuning dataset, ensuring robust performance across various interactive scenarios.
Experimental results show that Moshi excels in speech modeling and spoken QA tasks, especially
in latency, achieving a theoretical latency of 160 milliseconds and 200 milliseconds in practice,
significantly lower than the typical 230 milliseconds in natural conversation, enhancing real-time
interaction and conversation flow.
•Parrot. Parrot [ 149] model incorporates multiple features specifically designed to enhance
interaction in spoken dialogue. It uses a dual-channel audio setup, where each channel represents
a different speaker. This configuration allows Parrot to manage both sides of a conversation inde-
pendently, facilitating real-time turn-taking. By distinguishing between the user’s input and the
system’s response on separate channels, the model can listen and respond in parallel, creating a more
natural conversational flow. To handle simultaneous speaker inputs effectively, Parrot employs a
"next-token-pair prediction" mechanism, allowing it to predict tokens for both channels in a coordi-
nated sequence. This approach helps the model manage conversational dynamics such as overlapping
speech and smooth transitions between turns, adjusting response timing based on the user’s input.
During inference, Parrot supports streaming input, enabling continuous processing of user audio on
one channel while generating responses on the other. This streaming capability allows the model to
respond to live spoken input in real-time, handling turn-taking, pauses, and interruptions dynamically.
Unlike cascaded systems that rely on intermediate text conversions, Parrot processes audio directly,
reducing latency and allowing immediate responses to spoken input. These interaction-focused
design choices make Parrot highly responsive, enabling it to manage turn-taking naturally, respond to
interruptions, and handle overlapping speech,
•Mini-Omni2. Mini-Omni2 is an open-source multimodal large language model aimed at sim-
ulating the multimodal capabilities of GPT-4o in vision, hearing, and text, supporting real-time
full-duplex interaction. Mini-Omni2 combines visual and audio encoders with a language model to
enable simultaneous input and output of images, audio, and text. The model incorporates an interrupt
mechanism based on instruction design for more flexible user interactions. This system uses a delayed
parallel generation algorithm, allowing the model to generate text and audio responses simultaneously,
greatly improving conversational real-time capabilities and response speed. To achieve full-duplex
interaction, Mini-Omni2 introduces an interrupt mechanism based on a limited instruction approach,
trained on a specially constructed dataset with specific irq (interrupt) and n-irq (non-interrupt) state
markers for model optimization. For training Mini-Omni2’s interruption functionality, the researchers
used noisy speech data synthesized with specific command phrases (such as "Stop Omni") in various
voices and tones to simulate scenarios where users might issue interrupt commands. The dataset also
includes background noises, such as environmental sounds, music, and other dialogues, enhancing
the model’s robustness in complex environments. During training, Mini-Omni2 controls output flow
through irq and n-irq state markers, generating these markers in real-time to determine whether to
continue output. In this way, the model can immediately halt generation based on user instructions
and switch to "listening" mode in real-time dialogue. The training data consists of long audio streams
from which the model extracts and encodes user commands like "Stop Omni." Researchers inserted
interrupt commands at various time points, marking data after the insertion point as irq (interrupt) and
32

data before as n-irq (non-interrupt). This labeling method ensures that the model learns to accurately
identify interrupt commands in complex audio inputs and respond appropriately.
•SyncLLM. SyncLLM achieves full-duplex dialogue and interruption capabilities through multi-
stream interleaving and chunk processing. SyncLLM divides the conversation’s audio stream into
fixed-sized chunks, each corresponding to a specific time interval. The model alternates between
generating user and system speech segments within each time step (chunk), ensuring real-time system
responses while processing user speech input. To maintain temporal synchronization with the user,
SyncLLM predicts the user’s speech at each time step before generating each system chunk, using it
as context to infer the system’s next response. This mechanism enables the system to keep pace with
the conversation even with network latency. The chunk method allows SyncLLM to handle both user
and system audio streams simultaneously, supporting complex dialogue features like speech overlap,
interruption, and real-time feedback. Additionally, by using de-duplicated speech token sequences
and periodic synchronization markers, the model efficiently performs chunk-level real-time inference,
making conversation more fluid and natural.
•OmniFlatten. Similar to SyncLLM, the OmniFlatten model achieves full-duplex and interruption
functionality primarily through multi-stream data processing and progressive training. To enable
full-duplex dialogue, the model adopts a multi-stream architecture that interleaves the user’s speech
stream with the assistant’s speech and text streams into a single sequence for training, simplifying
multimodal modeling and enhancing real-time capability. The model first aligns the text language
model with modality through multitask supervised fine-tuning, enabling it to understand and generate
both speech and text, ensuring basic capability for handling speech and text simultaneously. Through
a progressive training process, OmniFlatten attains full-duplex capability in three stages: initial
training for half-duplex dialogue, then removing the user’s text stream to support real-time prediction
with multi-stream data, and finally removing the assistant’s text stream to enable pure speech stream
generation. These steps reduce reliance on text and decrease latency, allowing the system to generate
voice responses while receiving user speech input. By using a block-by-block generation strategy,
OmniFlatten divides the input and output speech sequences into fixed-size blocks, processing each
segment in turn. This effectively implements streaming processing, ensuring low latency and
high responsiveness in full-duplex dialogue, thereby providing a more natural response to user
interruptions.
•Freeze-Omni. To support duplex dialogue, Freeze-Omni [ 214] uses a chunk-level state prediction
mechanism for natural turn-taking. When the user begins speaking, a voice activity detection module
identifies the audio input, prompting the model to process the audio chunk by chunk. After processing
each chunk, the model’s classification layer predicts the conversation state to determine the next
action. There are three possible states: State 0, where the model continues listening for more input,
assuming the user hasn’t completed their turn; State 1, where the model interrupts to provide an
immediate response if a quick acknowledgment or feedback is needed; and State 2, where the model
has completed processing the current user input and is ready to generate and output a response,
thus transitioning smoothly into the response phase without further listening. This chunk-wise state
prediction enables the model to decide effectively when to respond and when to continue listening,
enhancing its ability to handle natural conversational cues and support interactive dialogue.
5.2.3 Discussions about streaming and interaction
Significant progress has been made in dialogues models, particularly in real-time interaction and
semantic understanding, with notable achievements in streaming processing and full-duplex interac-
tion. Current systems exhibit strong technical capabilities in reducing response latency, enhancing
interruption handling, and improving the naturalness of conversation. However, existing spoken
dialogues models still lack a unified system that can handle all forms of interaction seamlessly. Future
research could explore new frameworks to better manage both user interruptions and the system’s
ability to interrupt users, making interactions more natural. Additionally, standardized benchmarks
for evaluating interaction capabilities remain underdeveloped. A unified evaluation benchmark would
provide a consistent method for assessing and comparing the performance of different models, thereby
advancing the development of more intelligent and responsive interaction systems.

6 Training Resources and Evaluation
6.1 Training resources
Training a spoken dialogue system is a complex, multi-stage process, with each stage relying on
specific datasets to achieve distinct training objectives and enhance system performance. This
section provides an in-depth analysis of the training resources about the spoken dialogue models,
showcasing the data collection and processing methods at each stage and illustrating how these
elements contribute to the system’s intelligence. It further reveals how key steps, from foundational
architecture to fine-tuning, shape the intelligent development of dialogue systems.
To address the limitations of existing training spoken dialogue data and leverage the knowledge and
reasoning capabilities of mature text-based models, many approaches involve Continue Training on
pre-trained text language models. This training paradigm encompasses nearly all data types required
to build a spoken dialogue system. The following sections focus on analyzing data acquisition and
processing methods under this training flow, covering the following core stages: Text Language Model
Pre-training ,Post-Train for Audio Modal Adaption ,Post-Train for Dual-Stream Audio Processing ,
Enhancing Conversational Abilities and Instruction Tuning . We have listed commonly used datasets
for training in Table 2. However, current spoken dialogue models lack exploration in music and
sound. To support future development in spoken dialogue systems, we provide a list of common
music and sound datasets in the appendix A as a reference.
6.1.1 Training resources about Text LLM Pre-training
Text Language Model pre-training serves as the foundational stage for spoken dialogue models.
Through unsupervised learning on large-scale text data, the model acquires knowledge of vocabulary,
grammar, and contextual relationships, gaining essential knowledge and reasoning capabilities. Most
spoken dialogue systems are built upon pre-existing open-source text language models (such as
Llama [ 201], Palm [ 6], etc). Although we does not delve into this stage in detail, it provides a solid
foundation for the model’s natural language understanding and generation capabilities.
6.1.2 Training resources about Post-Train for Audio Modal Alignment
After establishing a text-based foundational model, the system possesses essential knowledge and
reasoning abilities. In this stage, we introduce the audio modality, enabling the text language model
to understand and generate speech while minimizing any potential loss of textual knowledge. This
process is known as modal adaption ormodal alignment . This multimodal structure incorporates
an audio encoder with a codebook, helping the model recognize linguistic, emotional, and tonal
information in speech. The audio decoder supports the generation of natural and fluent speech
output, while audio signal embeddings and special token types (e.g., speaker-distinguishing tokens
for Synchronous LLM, task-distinguishing tokens for OmniFlatten, and state tokens for VITA) are
added to the vocabulary of the text language model.
The primary goal at this stage is to align information from different modalities into a unified space
or representation, allowing the model to correlate and comprehend such information. Consequently,
the model is often trained on cross-modal tasks such as TTS , ASR , and audio captioning. The
datasets used include numerous paired audio and text samples to ensure effective conversion between
modalities. Commonly used TTS and ASR datasets include Aishell-3 [ 191], LibriTTS [ 241], TED-
LIUM [ 179], V oxPopuli [ 208], Librispeech [ 161], MLS [ 169], Wenetspeech [ 242], Gigaspeech [ 24],
VCTK [ 203], LJSpeech [ 89], Common V oice [ 8], and others. For audio captioning, Wavcaps [ 148]
are frequently used. Some speech datasets require ASR model transcription to generate corresponding
text.
In this phase, the emphasis is placed on capturing and generating audio features and aligning them
with text in vector space, rather than focusing on dialogue functionality.Therefore, the data typically
consists of single-channel audio, which can be used after resampling. Notably, in some works, it
is essential to ensure word-level alignment between text tokens and audio tokens (e.g., Spirit-LM,
Moshi, and OmniFlatten), achievable through tools like the Whisper-timestamped package or other
alignment tool. In Moshi, to prevent catastrophic forgetting, half of the training time is allocated to
text data, highlighting the importance of balancing text and audio data during training.

6.1.3 Training resources about Post-Train for Dual-Stream Dialogue Processing
To ensure that the model possesses the ability to “listen while speaking”. Most research such as
Moshi [ 44] and OmniFlatten [ 247] has implemented a dual audio-stream model: one audio stream
generates model output, while the other captures user audio. The objective of this training phase is to
enable the model’s dual-stream processing without requiring complex human-computer interaction
modeling. Consequently, text dialogue data can be converted to speech and processed into dual-track
audio format. However, text dialogue data typically contains content unsuitable for TTS conversion
to speech (such as code, formulas, URLs) or long, formal dialogue passages that do not align with
spoken language, as real dialogue is often more concise. Therefore, when synthesizing from text
dialogue data, it is necessary to preprocess the text data. High-quality, open-source text dialogue
data is first collected, including datasets like Alpaca [ 145], Moss, BelleCN, ultraChat [ 46], and
Open-Orca [ 125]. To ensure suitability for speech synthesis (TTS), heuristic rules are applied to filter
out samples with high proportions of non-text elements (such as code, mathematical expressions),
samples exceeding 200 words, and samples containing rare symbols.
After filtering the text, TTS models [ 49] are used to synthesize speech for each turn in the dialogues.
For consistent voice effects, the model audio stream maintains a uniform voice, while the user audio
stream is sampled with varied voices to enhance the model’s robustness. The synthesized dialogue
audio is arranged using simulation strategies to achieve natural timing, such as turn-taking, well-timed
interruptions, and pauses to maintain fluency and naturalness. The final dialogue audio is organized
in dual-channel format: the conversation begins with a user utterance, followed by alternating user
and assistant turns. After each user turn, the assistant responds immediately; upon completion of the
assistant’s turn, a sampled pause length is introduced to simulate the natural rhythm of alternating
dialogue. To better simulate real scenarios, further data augmentation can be applied. For example,
random gain adjustments can be applied to the user audio stream, and background noise randomly
selected from datasets like MUSAN [ 195] and DNS [ 175] can be added to the user audio channel
(OmniFlatten). To simulate echo effects from a user’s microphone, portions of the audio stream
can be scaled down and added to the user’s audio stream with random delays between 100 to 500
milliseconds, along with reverberation-like enhancements, helping the model adapt to real-world
environments.
6.1.4 Training resources about Enhancing Conversational Abilities and Instruction Tuning
While the foundational model has been established, there remains a gap between this and a complete
dialogue system. The above model utilizes non-overlapping dialogue audio, where one party remains
silent while the other speaks, failing to fully simulate real conversational dynamics. Some speech
datasets, such as Generative Expressive Conversational Speech Synthesis [138] and Fisher , contain
dialogues from real-world settings, providing a basis for modeling interruptions and backchannels
scenarios in voice dialogue systems.
35

Currently, there is no suitable dataset for real-world speech instructions. Most approaches use
synthetic methods based on text instruction data to perform instruction tuning in this stage. Common
text instruction datasets include Open Hermes andmoss-002-sft-data , though they face similar
challenges as text dialogue data, such as unsuitability for TTS conversion and inconsistency with
spoken language conventions. Following the synthetic processes provided by Moshi and Llama-
Omni, this aims to generate instruction data in the format of (SpeechInstruction, TextInstruction,
TextResponse, SpeechResponse).
The first method is synthetic generation from scratch. Contexts and summaries are first generated by
sourcing high-quality text data from sources like Wikipedia and StackExchange, producing thematic
paragraphs as the dialogue foundation, referred to as “context.” Based on these contexts, dialogue
summaries are generated. Next, a specific prompt template guides the generation of complete
dialogues, including context and requesting dialogues around the theme with roles as user and system.
The model is prompted to exhibit knowledge on the topic and include interruptions (backchannels) and
brief turn-taking, simulating the natural flow of conversation. To enhance dialogue diversity, additional
instructions involving speech emotion and role-playing can be generated, requesting dialogues in
specific tones or styles. Furthermore, dialogues containing spelling errors or misinformation are
synthesized to train the system in handling scenarios where user clarification or repetition is required.
Single-turn interactions on basic mathematics, grammar, and factual questions are also generated
to ensure the system can handle simple factual tasks. Finally, scenarios involving ethical or NSFW
requests are created to train the system in declining to answer under such conditions.
The second method involves filtering and refining existing text instruction datasets. Initially, open-
source text language models paraphrase text instructions to match spoken language traits, adding
fillers like “uh” and “um” to mimic natural speech tone, while converting numbers and symbols
into spoken language to ensure the instructions are concise and conversational. Generated text
responses are also optimized to meet TTS output requirements, removing lengthy expressions and
complex grammatical structures to make content clear and concise for TTS output. After adjusting
the instruction and response text, a TTS system converts the text to audio.
6.2 Evaluation
Fair and comprehensive evaluation of spoken dialogue models presents a multifaceted challenge.
On the one hand, the field of spoken dialogue still lacks publicly available test sets, comprehensive
evaluation metrics, and established benchmarks. On the other hand, assessing the performance of
spoken dialogue systems requires consideration from multiple perspectives. Basic aspects include
the quality of generated speech, robustness, dialogue naturalness and accuracy, as well as response
speed and generation time. Beyond these, more advanced evaluations are needed to assess multi-
turn dialogue capabilities (such as long-form speech editing), interaction abilities, and the system’s
proficiency in audio and music understanding and generation. Given these requirements, and in line
with the comprehensive expectations for spoken dialogue systems outlined in Section 2.1, we will
evaluate these systems from two angles: common evaluations and advanced evaluations. Specifically,
we will assess eleven key factors: speech generation quality, text intelligence, speech intelligence,
audio and music generation, audio and music understanding, multilingual capability, context learning,
interaction capability, streaming latency, multimodal capability, and the safety of dialogue systems.
Finally, we will list the current benchmarks and summarize the common conclusions derived from
them.
6.2.1 Common Evaluation
Text Intelligence. As shown in Figure 4 (a), text intelligence refers to the fundamental understanding
and generation capabilities of the spoken dialogue model. When evaluating text intelligence, the
focus is solely on the semantic content generated by the model, without considering other aspects
such as timbre, emotion, or style. In practical evaluations of this kind, some spoken dialogue models
output only text [ 192,199,34,33,228], while others generate both text and speech [ 44,223,224],
or only speech [ 247]. Regardless of the output format, we are concerned only with the generated text
or the transcribed text from the speech when evaluation the text intelligence in the spoken dialogue
models. There are typically two categories of metrics and benchmarks used to assess text intelligence,
MT-Metrics and Acc-Metrics. The details are outlined as follows:
36

Table 3: This table provides a comprehensive overview of the different components used to evaluate
dialogue systems, including various abilities, common tasks, representative benchmarks, and cor-
responding metrics. The abilities include Text Intelligence, Speech Quality, Audio Understanding
and Generation, Music Understanding and Generation, Multilingual Capability, Context Learning,
Interaction Capability, Multimodal Capability, Security, and Speech Intelligence. The table aligns
these tasks with widely used benchmarks such as V oiceBench, SUPERB, AudioBench, AirBench,
SpokenWOZ, SD-EV AL, SuperCLUE, and MMAU, highlighting the dimensions they assess. To
ensure comprehensive evaluation some metrics are defined: MT-Metrics , which evaluate the quality
of generated outputs using semantic and syntactic similarity; Acc-Metrics , which measure recog-
nition performance using precision, recall, and F-score; Subjective Metrics , which assess creative
and generative tasks like speech quality and audio generation. This structured framework provides a
holistic view of benchmarks, tasks, and evaluation criteria for assessing diverse model capabilities.

•ACC-Metrics. A common approach to evaluating text intelligence is to use benchmarks typi-
cally [ 198,126,240,38,182,26,256,154,216,58] employed for large language models, such as the
classic MMLU [ 76] and GSM-8K [ 39]. These benchmarks often include complex multiple-choice
questions, which assess the model’s reasoning abilities through Acc-Metrics. Acc-Metrics refers to
metrics that measure recognition accuracy, such as accuracy, F-score, and Mean Average Precision
(mAP). It is noteworthy that these benchmarks often evaluate the text-based intelligence of spoken
dialogue models from various perspectives. For example, MMLU [ 76] and GSM-8K [ 39] are more
focused on LLM’s core knowledge, Flan [ 140,218] and Self-instruct [ 215] are more focused on
LLM’s instruction following capability, CoQA [ 176] and OpenAssistant [ 113] are more focused
on LLM’s conversational capability. These benchmarks often contain questions and corresponding
answers. Most of these questions are close-ended questions with short answers, so that they can have
good generalization ability, any model that can generate text answers can be evaluated with these
benchmarks and accuracy and F-Score can be easily adopted as the evaluation metrics.
•MT-Metrics. With the development of the LLMs, LLMs can follow instructions to accomplish
many complex problems, so the scope of the evaluation was further expanded to include open-ended
questions. These open-ended questions often lack standard answers, therefore it’s difficult to measure
them by common ACC-Metrics. A common approach is to measure the grammatical similarity
between generated and reference utterances using the metrics used to measure grammatical similarity
in mechanical translation (e.g. BLEU [ 162], METEOR [ 13], ROUGE [ 127]). We collectively refer to
these evaluation metrics as MT-Metrics . However, these metrics have certain limitations since one
meaning has many different ways to convey. So there are some metrics like BertScore [ 248] focus on
evaluating the semantic similarity between two sentences. And there are also been some methods
utilizing LLM to judge the effectiveness of the responses which focusing on human preference
[253,139]. The results of these large model-based especially GPT4o-based ratings of evaluation
metrics demonstrated a high degree of correlation with human.
Speech Quality. Speech quality is one of the fundamental aspects for evaluating the performance
of spoken dialogue systems, as it is closely tied to the experience of users. There are two common
dimensions for assessing speech quality: the clarity and naturalness (expressiveness and prosody)
of the generated audio, and the robustness of the generated speech, such as the presence of missing
37

or extra words. The former is typically evaluated by using subjective MOS (Mean Opinion Score)
ratings, while the latter is commonly assessed by using WER (Word Error Rate) or CER (Character
Error Rate) metrics.
Streaming Latency. In addition to evaluating the quality of text understanding and generated
speech, the speed at which a spoken dialogue system generates speech responses is also crucial.
This necessitates the ability to stream both the comprehension and generation of speech in real time,
achieving an effect of generating speech while speaking [ 249,44,57]. To assess the streaming
performance of a model, one typically measures the time taken to generate the first token of speech
(i.e., the waiting time after the user finishes speaking) and calculates the overall Real-Time Factor
(RTF) of the spoken dialogue model’s response. The RTF value is obtained by dividing the total
duration of the speech segment generated by the model by the time taken by the model to generate
that response.
6.2.2 Advanced Evaluation
Speech Intelligence. Evaluating the speech intelligence of spoken dialogue systems is one of the
key aspects. The definition of speech intelligence in spoken dialogue systems is discussed in detail
in Section 2.1.2. Given that speech intelligence encompasses a wide range of application scenarios,
we address the evaluation separately for the understanding and generation components during the
assessment.
•Understanding. Ordinary cascaded spoken dialog models based on ASR getting text input will
loss many paralinguistic information like speaking style, accent, emotion, etc. Thus many spoken
dialogue models [ 228,129,128] devoted into helping dialog models understand the paralinguistic
information. Evaluating this capability can start from two aspects: a) the accuracy of the paralinguistic
information’s understanding, b) the ability of automatically generating appropriate and coherent
content responses and acoustic information based on the varying acoustic input. For the former ,
since the classes of the paralinguistic information are always limited, for example, sentiments are
generally categorized as neural, negative, positive. So the researchers always use Accuracy or F-Score
to evaluate the models’ paralinguistic information understanding capability. Recently, there are many
studies [ 66,19,168,228,128,59,20] available for researchers to use in identifying speech emotions
in the dialogue scenes. In addition to recognizing speech emotions, recent benchmarks [ 7,235] has
also begun to investigate the influence of speaker age, accent, and other factors on the evaluation of
spoken dialogue models. For the latter , recent work [ 228] has increasingly focused on the possibility
of generating appropriate content responses based on acoustic information from the input. The
current evaluation methods usually transcript the output audio into text through Automatic Speech
Recognition and then evaluate the relevance between generated content and the reference content in
the internal dataset. Evaluations are usually conducted in text, so commonly used evaluation metrics
are as the same as in the section 6.2.1, like BLEU and METEOR, which are used to measure the
similarity between two sentences. Currently, there is limited research exploring whether spoken
dialogue models can autonomously generate appropriate acoustic responses based on varying acoustic
information, making it a promising area for future investigation.
•Generation. In the generation component, evaluating the speech intelligence of spoken dialogue
systems primarily focuses on controllability, i.e., the ability of the dialogue model to respond in a
user-specified style and timbre in the zero-shot scenarios. There are various dimensions to assess
style, such as pitch, speech rate, energy, emotion, and accent, among others. ACC-metrics can be used
to evaluate whether the spoken dialogue model can generate speech in the desired style. Additionally,
the evaluation of voice cloning capabilities within the model can borrow metrics from the zero-shot
TTS domain [ 210,190,91,211], using speaker similarity indices [ 27]. Currently, there are few
models that explore the generation of speech intelligence in spoken dialogue systems, and this area
warrants further refinement and exploration in future work.
Audio Understanding and Generation. In real-world scenarios, the broader definition of speech
modality encompasses not only clear human speech but also a wide range of natural sounds such as
dog barking and bird chirping, all of which can be considered forms of audio. Evaluating the ability
of spoken dialogue models to understand and generate such audio is a critical aspect of assessing the
model’s performance.
•Audio Understanding. On the audio comprehension side, various sub-tasks are commonly
employed to measure a system’s capacity to understand audio, including tasks such as Audio
38

Captioning (AudioCap) [ 106], Sound Event Detection (SED) [ 153], audio classification, and audio-
motivated creative writing [ 34], among others. The core of these tasks lies in evaluating the model’s
ability to process and interpret the complex acoustic information embedded within the audio. For tasks
like audio classification and SED, which involve fixed outputs, evaluation is relatively straightforward,
typically using objective metrics such as accuracy or Mean Average Precision (mAP). However, for
the AudioCap task, the problem is generally open-ended, meaning there are no fixed answers. As
a result, existing evaluation methods are primarily based on measuring the similarity between the
generated text and the reference text, using traditional metrics such as BLEU [ 162] and METEOR
[13], or newer evaluation approaches involving large language models such as GPT-4o [ 253]. In the
case of audio-motivated creative writing, where the objective is to generate inventive descriptions
from a given audio input, evaluation typically relies on subjective measures, given the divergent
nature of the creative process involved.
•Audio Generation. Additionally, on the audio generation side, producing high-quality audio
should be considered an advanced capability for a conversational spoken dialogue model. However,
as most current spoken dialogue systems lack the ability to generate audio, this remains an area for
further exploration in the future end-to-end spoken dialogue systems. The evaluation of generated
audio can draw from methods used in the text-to-audio domain [ 82,84]. Typically, such evaluations
focus on the quality of the generated audio itself, using metrics such as Mean Opinion Score
(MOS) and the similarity between generated and target audio. Objective evaluation metrics for
audio similarity often include Fréchet Distance (FD), Inception Score (IS), Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence, Fréchet Audio Distance (FAD), and CLAP score. Specifically, Fréchet Audio Distance
(FAD) [ 105] is adapted from the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) to the audio domain and serves as
a reference-free perceptual metric that quantifies the distance between the generated and ground-truth
audio distributions. The Inception Score (IS) is an effective metric that evaluates both the quality
and diversity of generated audio. KL divergence is computed at the paired sample level between
generated and ground-truth audio, based on the label distribution and averaged to produce a final
result. Fréchet Distance (FD) evaluates the similarity between the generated and ground-truth audio
distributions. FD, KL, and IS are built upon the PANNs model [ 111], which takes mel-spectrograms
as input. In contrast, FAD uses VGGish [ 77] as an audio classifier, processing raw audio waveforms
as input. The CLAP score, adapted from the CLIP score [ 78], is a reference-free metric used to assess
audio-text alignment and strongly correlates with human perception.
Music Understanding and Generation. In advanced spoken dialogue models, the evaluation of
music modality understanding and generation follows a methodology similar to that used for audio
modality. Unlike Audio Understanding, which only requires a general description of the events
that occur in the audio, Music Understanding requires appreciating the style and genre of music,
understanding its keys, themes, and other rich information. For classification, emotion recognition
tasks in music, common metrics such as accuracy can be used. For music captioning task, MusicCaps
[2] offers a general dataset for evaluating a model’s music understanding capability. For music
analysis, Nsynth [ 56] provides rich note data information. In terms of evaluation for music generation,
subjective Mean Opinion Score (MOS) assessments or measures of similarity between generated
music and target music are commonly used.
Multilingual Capability. The ability to speak multiple languages is also required for a spoken
dialogue model, but most current models [ 68,128,129,192,209,228] only focus on English and
Chinese. A naive idea is to directly evaluate spoken dialogue models’ capability in speech-to-
speech or speech-to-text translation tasks [ 95,207]. These evaluations can be done with common
machine learning metrics like BLEU [ 162] or BertScore [ 248]. However, evaluating the capability
of translation is insufficient to measure the model’s multilingual conversational ability, and further
exploration is still needed in this area of evaluation. Explicitly requiring a spoken dialogue model
to perform speech translation is not a typical use case in conversational scenarios. In most cases,
when a user asks a question in a different language or with a distinct accent, the model is expected
to automatically respond in the same language that the user is using. In this context, it seems
more reasonable to evaluate the accuracy of the model’s generated speech in terms of language
identification, combined with subjective human assessments, as a more intuitive and appropriate
evaluation method.
Context Learning. The context learning capability is crucial for maintaining the coherence of an
entire conversation. Similar to a memory function, the challenge lies in how to preserve this capability
when relying solely on speech. Typically, the evaluation of a spoken dialogue model’s context
39

learning ability depends on specific long-duration dialogue test sets, after which standard MT-Metrics
or Acc-Metrics used in text intelligence evaluations can be applied. For instance, a model’s context
learning capability can be assessed by evaluating its QA performance based on the given context
[133]. However, it is important to note the relevance of editing scenarios in long-duration spoken
dialogues. In real spoken dialogue scenarios, the users will modify some certain key information, the
model needs to promptly understand and respond accordingly, e.g., the users offer wrong information
for solving a problem and modify the condition in the next dialog. So how to evaluate the model’s
online understanding ability is still needed further study.
Interaction Capability. Interactive ability is also an essential metric for assessing the advanced
capabilities of spoken dialogue systems. As illustrated in Figure 4 (b), basic interactive ability refers
to the system’s capacity to allow users to interrupt the conversation at any time. In this context, it
is crucial to evaluate whether the spoken dialogue model can promptly comprehend the user’s new
input and halt its current response. This is commonly measured using accuracy. Furthermore, it is
important to assess whether the model can generate a coherent and appropriate response based on the
new input, which ties back to previous evaluation standards related to text and speech intelligence.
In addition, in real-world scenarios, beyond basic interruptions, various discourse markers such as
"okay", "haha" are often used to indicate interaction. Current spoken dialogue systems [ 158] typically
track the frequency of these markers as a standard evaluation metric. Looking ahead, it may be
valuable to assess whether future spoken dialogue models can effectively and appropriately interrupt
human speakers, which could also represent a key dimension for evaluation the interaction capability.
Multimodal Capability. Spoken dialogue models primarily focus on the audio modality for both
input and output. However, considering the close coupling between video and audio modalities in
practical applications of dialogue systems, recent advancements in spoken dialogue models have
incorporated the understanding of video and images in the input stage [ 61,123,163] , indicate that
future spoken dialogue models need to simultaneously understand visual information and audio
information to achieve real-time Audio-Visual Understandings. The evaluation of such models
generally still focuses on the evaluation of dialogue quality, that is, whether the generated dialogue
and the reference dialogue are similar. Therefore, this aspect can still be evaluated using metrics
such as BLEU [ 162] and METEOR [ 13] to assess sentence semantic similarity. However, research in
this area also focuses on the understanding of visual information, and how to evaluate the model’s
correct understanding of real-time visual information in dialogue is also a difficulty, still can be a
future benchmark direction.
Security. Security is also an integral part of the evaluation, how to ensure that the output of the model
complies with ethical and social norms is a critical aspect. Spoken dialogue models may encounter
security issues such as harmful content generation, privacy pitfalls, bias, and adversarial attacks.
There has been considerable research progress in evaluating text modalities [ 47]. The commonly
used metric is to evaluate the attack success rate of injection attacks and so on. However, there are
relatively few evaluation methods in the field of speech modality. How to construct a dataset for
attacking spoken dialogue models, avoid poisoning of speech data, and evaluate the model’s speech
defense capabilities as benchmarks are required further research in the field of spoken dialogue model
evaluation in the future.
6.3 Benchmark
We list the common benchmarks for evaluating voice dialogue systems in the table3, and briefly
introduce each benchmark in this section.
•VoiceBench. V oiceBench’s [ 29] Key evaluation dimensions include general knowledge,
instruction-following ability, and safety compliance. The benchmark incorporates both synthetic and
real spoken instructions to simulate diverse speaker styles, environmental conditions, and content
variations. It challenges systems with tasks involving accent adaptability, handling noisy environ-
ments, and robustness against content irregularities such as grammatical errors, disfluencies, and
mispronunciations. Additionally, it explores the systems’ resilience under varying speaker character-
istics (age, pitch, and speaking speed) and environmental challenges like reverberation, background
noise, and far-field effects.
•SUPERB.[ 236]The benchmark evaluates speech processing models across multiple dimensions,
including content recognition, speaker modeling, semantic understanding, and paralinguistic analysis.
40

Tasks in content recognition cover phoneme recognition, automatic speech recognition, keyword
spotting, and query-by-example spoken term detection, focusing on transcription and content detection
accuracy. Speaker modeling involves tasks like speaker identification, automatic speaker verification,
and speaker diarization to assess speaker-related features. Semantic understanding includes intent
classification and slot filling, testing models’ ability to infer high-level meaning directly from
raw audio. Paralinguistic analysis focuses on emotion recognition, capturing models’ ability to
interpret affective cues from speech. The evaluation framework uses publicly available datasets and
conventional metrics to provide a standardized testbed for assessing generalizability and task-specific
performance.
•AudioBench. AudioBench [ 206] evaluates spoken dialogue models across three primary dimen-
sions: speech understanding, audio scene understanding, and voice (paralinguistic) understanding. It
encompasses eight distinct tasks and leverages 26 datasets, including seven newly developed datasets.
The evaluation emphasizes models’ ability to handle instruction-following tasks conditioned on audio
signals, addressing aspects such as speech recognition accuracy, environmental sound interpretation,
and paralinguistic feature extraction (e.g., emotion, gender, accent).
•AirBench. AIR-Bench [ 235] assesses the capabilities of Spoken dialogue models to understand
and interact based on various audio types, including human speech, natural sounds, and music. It
consists of two primary components: a foundation benchmark with 19 specific audio tasks and
over 19,000 single-choice questions, and a chat benchmark featuring more than 2,000 open-ended
audio-prompted questions. The foundation benchmark evaluates fundamental skills such as speech
recognition, acoustic scene classification, and music genre identification, focusing on specific subtasks
to diagnose model weaknesses. The chat benchmark tests the models’ ability to handle complex,
real-world audio-based queries, including mixed audio with varying loudness and temporal offsets.
AIR-Bench introduces a novel audio mixing strategy to simulate complex real-world scenarios and
employs GPT-4-based evaluation to judge model-generated hypotheses against reference answers.
•SpokenWOZ. SpokenWOZ [ 193] evaluates task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems in spoken
scenarios, addressing challenges unique to spoken conversations, such as incremental processing,
disfluencies, incomplete utterances, and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) noise. It introduces
novel metrics to assess performance in tasks like cross-turn slot detection and reasoning slot detection,
which require integrating information across multiple turns and reasoning from implicit cues. The
benchmark encompasses multi-domain, human-to-human dialogues with diverse speech characteris-
tics, testing systems on both textual and auditory inputs through large-scale annotated datasets with
over 200,000 utterances and 249 hours of audio
•SD-EVAL. SD-Eval [ 7] evaluates spoken dialogue models across multiple dimensions, focusing on
both spoken understanding and response generation beyond textual content. It assesses models’ abili-
ties to process three key types of information embedded in speech: content (e.g., linguistic meaning),
paralinguistic cues (e.g., emotion, accent, age), and environmental context (e.g., background sounds).
The benchmark consists of four sub-tasks—emotion, accent, age, and environment—constructed
from diverse datasets and totaling 7,303 utterances spanning 8.76 hours.
•SuperCLUE. SuperCLUE evaluates spoken dialogue systems across four main dimensions: voice
interaction, general capabilities, scenario applications, and response speed. Key metrics include
interruption recognition, speech tone adjustment, semantic understanding, naturalness of speech, and
memory accuracy. Additionally, it measures real-time data retrieval, reasoning ability, compliance
with commands, and multilingual translation accuracy. Scenario-specific applications like emotional
counseling, health consultations, and customer service are assessed for precision and effectiveness.
The final aspect is response timeliness, focusing on latency and delay management.However, this
benchmark is not open source and focuse on Mandarine ability
•MMAU. MMAU [ 183] evaluates spoken dialogue models across multiple dimensions, encom-
passing 27 distinct tasks divided into reasoning and information extraction categories. It assesses
models on their ability to comprehend and reason about speech, sound, and music by leveraging
advanced cognitive skills and domain-specific knowledge. Key evaluated areas include temporal event
reasoning, speaker role mapping, emotional tone interpretation, eco-acoustic knowledge, phonemic
stress pattern analysis, and melodic structure interpretation. It examines not just basic recognition
or transcription capabilities but also models’ proficiency in complex reasoning, contextual under-
standing, and the ability to extract and apply world knowledge. Additionally, MMAU scrutinizes
41

performance consistency across varying difficulty levels, testing systems’ depth of reasoning and
robustness in real-world audio scenarios.
7 Conclusion
In this work, we systematically review the research related to spoken dialogue models, categorizing
it according to two paradigms: cascaded spoken dialogue models and end-to-end spoken dialogue
models. Additionally, we provide a detailed overview of the core technologies behind spoken
dialogue models, including speech representation, training paradigms, streaming duplex systems,
and interaction mechanisms. In the speech representation module, we classify and explain the
representations from both the input and output perspectives, focusing on different types of semantic
and acoustic representations. In the training paradigm module, we thoroughly discuss five modalities
of alignment for spoken dialogue models, multi-stage training strategies, model architectures, and
generation paradigms. Following this, we provide an in-depth analysis of streaming input and output
for spoken dialogue models, as well as the related duplex interaction technologies. Finally, we
compile key training resources, evaluation metrics, and benchmarks relevant to spoken dialogue
models. We specifically address the evaluation of different levels of intelligence in spoken dialogue
models across various scenarios. It is important to note that, given that spoken dialogue models are a
relatively new and emerging technology, many aspects such as semantic and acoustic representations,
still lack well-established paradigms. Therefore, at the end of each section, we include a dedicated
discussion module to explore these open issues. We hope that this survey will contribute to the further
development of the field of spoken dialogue systems.
