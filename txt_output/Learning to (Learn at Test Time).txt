Abstract
Self-attention performs well in long context but has quadratic complexity. Existing RNN layers
have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power
of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity
and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model
itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated
by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers . We
consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a
two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters,
comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP
match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by
conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems
optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in
wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long
context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.

to training the model fat test time. This process, known as test-time training (TTT), is programmed into our
TTT layers.

1 Introduction
In 2020, the OpenAI scaling law paper (Kaplan et. al [ 40]) showed that LSTMs (a type of RNN)
could not scale similarly to Transformers or e ffectively use long context. Now, with modern RNNs
and best practices, we re-evaluate these findings in Figure 2.
On the left, we observe that Mamba [ 26] – one of the most popular RNNs today – scales similarly to
a strong Transformer, showing great progress since the LSTMs in 2020. However, on the right, we
observe the same issue with Mamba as Kaplan et al. did with LSTMs. Tokens later in a sequence
should be easier to predict on average, since they condition on more information. This is indeed the
case for Transformer, whose average perplexity at each token index decreases throughout its 32k
context. In contrast, the same metric plateaus for Mamba after 16k.
This result represents an awkward reality for existing RNNs. On one hand, the main advantage of
RNNs (vs. Transformers) is their linear (vs. quadratic) complexity. This asymptotic advantage is
only realized in practice for long context, which according to Figure 3 is after 8k. On the other hand,
once context is long enough, existing RNNs such as Mamba struggle to actually take advantage of
the extra information being conditioned on.
The difficulty with long context is inherent to the very nature of RNN layers: Unlike self-attention,
RNN layers have to compress context into a hidden state of fixed size. As a compression heuristic,
2

the update rule needs to discover the underlying structures and relationships among thousands
or potentially millions of tokens. In this paper, we begin with the observation that self-supervised
learning can compress a massive training set into the weights of a model such as an LLM, which
often exhibits deep understanding about the semantic connections among its training data – exactly
what we need from a compression heuristic.
TTT layers. Motivated by this observation, we design a new class of sequence modeling layers
where the hidden state is a model, and the update rule is a step of self-supervised learning. Because
the process of updating the hidden state on a test sequence is equivalent to training a model at test
time, this new class of layers is called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers . We introduce two simple
instantiations within this class: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, where the hidden state is a linear model
and a two-layer MLP, respectively. TTT layers can be integrated into any network architecture and
optimized end-to-end, similar to RNNs layers and self-attention.
Wall-clock time. While the TTT layer is already e fficient in FLOPs, we propose two practical
innovations to make it e fficient in wall-clock time. First, similar to the standard practice of taking
gradient steps on mini-batches of sequences during regular training for better parallelism, we use
mini-batches of tokens during TTT. Second, we develop a dual form for operations inside each
TTT mini-batch, to better take advantage of modern GPUs and TPUs. The dual form is equivalent
in output to the naive implementation, but trains more than 5×faster. As shown in Figure 3,
TTT-Linear is faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba.
Evaluations and open problems. While we have highlighted some results for TTT-Linear at the
beginning of the paper, Section 3 presents more comprehensive evaluations for both TTT-Linear and
TTT-MLP, and open problems exposed by our evaluations. For example, our evaluations following
the Chinchilla recipe [ 34] do not cleanly fit a linear scaling trend even for the Transformer baseline.
Constrained by our academic resources, we encourage the community to join us in exploring
solutions to these problems.
Summary of contributions.
1.We propose TTT layers, a new class of sequence modeling layers where the hidden state is a
model, and the update rule is self-supervised learning. Our perspective that the forward pass of
a layer contains a training loop itself opens up a new direction for future research.
2.TTT-Linear, one simple instantiation of TTT layers, outperforms Transformers and Mamba in our
evaluations ranging from 125M to 1.3B parameters.
3.We improve the hardware e fficiency of TTT layers through mini-batch TTT and the dual form,
making TTT-Linear already a practical building block for LLMs.
2 Method
All sequence modeling layers can be viewed from the perspective of storing historic context into
a hidden state, as shown in Figure 4.1For example, RNN layers – such as LSTM [ 33], RWKV [ 56]
and Mamba [ 26] layers – compress context into a state of fixed size across time. This compression
has two consequences. On one hand, mapping an input token xtto output token ztis efficient,
because both the update rule and output rule take constant time per token. On the other hand, the
performance of RNN layers in long context is limited by the expressive power of its hidden state st.
1We define a sequence modeling layer as an autoregressive mapping from one sequence to another.

Figure 4. Top: A generic sequence modeling layer expressed as a hidden state that transitions according to an
update rule. All sequence modeling layers can be viewed as di fferent instantiations of three components in this
figure: the initial state, update rule and output rule. Bottom : Examples of sequence modeling layers and their
instantiations of the three components. The naive TTT layer was shown in Figure 1. Self-attention has a hidden
state growing with context, therefore growing cost per token. Both the naive RNN and TTT layer compress the
growing context into a hidden state of fixed size, therefore their cost per token stays constant.
Self-attention can also be viewed from the perspective above, except that its hidden state, commonly
known as the Key-Value (KV) cache, is a list that grows linearly with t. Its update rule simply
appends the current KV tuple to this list, and the output rule scans over all tuples up to tto form
the attention matrix. The hidden state explicitly stores all historic context without compression,
making self-attention more expressive than RNN layers for long context. However, scanning this
linearly growing hidden state also takes linearly growing time per token.
To remain both e fficient and expressive in long context, we need a better compression heuristic.
Specifically, we need to compress thousands or potentially millions of tokens into a hidden state
that can e ffectively capture their underlying structures and relationships. This might sound like a
tall order, but all of us are actually already familiar with such a heuristic.
2.1 TTT as updating a hidden state
The process of parametric learning can be viewed as compressing a massive training set into the
weights of a model. Specifically, we know that models trained with self-supervision can capture the
underlying structures and relationships behind their training data [ 48] – exactly what we need from
a compression heuristic.
LLMs themselves are great examples. Trained with the self-supervised task of next-token prediction,
their weights can be viewed as a compressed form of storage for existing knowledge on the internet.
By querying LLMs, we can extract knowledge from their weights. More importantly, LLMs often
exhibit a deep understanding of the semantic connections among existing knowledge to express
new pieces of reasoning [1].
Our key idea is to use self-supervised learning to compress the historic context x1,...,xtinto a
hidden state st, by making the context an unlabeled dataset and the state a model. Concretely, the
hidden state stis now equivalent to Wt, the weights of a model f, which can be a linear model, a

small neural network, or anything else. The output rule is simply:
zt=f(xt;Wt). (1)
Intuitively, the output token is just the prediction on xt, made byfwith the updated weights Wt.
The update rule is a step of gradient descent on some self-supervised loss ℓ:
Wt=Wt−1−η∇ℓ(Wt−1;xt), (2)
with learning rate η.2From the compression point of view, every heuristic needs to decide which
input to remember or forget. Our Wremembers inputs that produce large gradients – intuitively,
inputs that make Wlearn a lot.
One choice of ℓis reconstructing xtitself. To make the learning problem nontrivial, we first process
xtinto a corrupted input ˜xt(details in Subsection 2.3), then optimize:
ℓ(W;xt) =∥f(˜xt;W)−xt∥2. (3)
Similar to denoising autoencoders [ 75],fneeds to discover the correlations between dimensions of
xtin order to reconstruct it from partial information ˜xt.3As shown in Figure 5, gradient descent is
able to reduce ℓ, but cannot reduce it to zero. We discuss more sophisticated formulations of the
self-supervised task in Subsection 2.3.
As with other RNN layers and self-attention, our algorithm that maps an input sequence x1,...,xTto
output sequence z1,...,zTcan be programmed into the forward pass of a sequence modeling layer,
using the hidden state, update rule, and output rule above. Even at test time, our new layer still
trains a di fferent sequence of weights W1,...,WTfor every input sequence. Therefore, we call it the
Test-Time Training (TTT) layer .
2.2 Training a network with TTT layers
The forward pass of a TTT layer also has a corresponding backward pass. Our forward pass only
consists of standard di fferentiable operators except the gradient operator ∇. However,∇just maps
2For now, consider W0= 0. We will discuss more sophisticated techniques for initializing Win Subsection 2.7.
3In past experiments, we have also tried adding another model g(decoder) after f(encoder), such that the reconstruction
is produced by g◦finstead of only fitself. While this heftier design did slightly improve results, it made overall training
less stable and added significant computational cost. Therefore we focus on the encoder-only design.

TTT_Layer can be dropped into a larger network like other sequence modeling layers. Training the network will
optimize the parameters of Task inTTT_Layer , because both are subclasses of nn.Module . Since Learner is

one function to another, in this case ℓto∇ℓ, and∇ℓis also composed of di fferentiable operators.
Conceptually, calling backward on ∇ℓmeans taking gradients of gradients – a well explored
technique in meta-learning [51].
TTT layers have the same interface as RNN layers and self-attention, therefore can be replaced in
any larger network architecture, which usually contains many of these sequence modeling layers.
Training a network with TTT layers also works the same way as training any other language model,
such as a Transformer. The same data, recipe, and objective such as next-token prediction can be
used to optimize parameters of the rest of the network.
We refer to training the larger network as the outer loop , and training Wwithin each TTT layer
as the inner loop . An important di fference between the two nested learning problems is that the
inner-loop gradient ∇ℓis taken w.r.t. W, the parameters of f, while the outer-loop gradient is taken
w.r.t the parameters of the rest of the network, which we will denote by θrest. Throughout this paper,
outer-loop parameters are always denoted by θwith various subscripts.
So far, the TTT layer has no outer-loop parameters, in contrast to other RNN layers and self-attention.
In Subsection 2.3, we add outer-loop parameters to the TTT layer to improve its self-supervised task.
Then in Subsection 2.4 and 2.5, we discuss two ways to improve the wall-clock time of TTT layers.
2.3 Learning a self-supervised task for TTT
Arguably the most important part of TTT is the self-supervised task, because it determines the kind
of features that Wwill learn from the test sequence. So how should we design this task? The final
goal of TTT is for zt=f(xt;Wt)to perform well on language modeling. Instead of handcrafting a
6

self-supervised task from human priors, we take a more end-to-end approach – directly optimizing
the self-supervised task for the final goal of next-token prediction.
Concretely, we learn the self-supervised task as part of the outer loop. Starting from the naive
reconstruction task in Equation 3, we add some outer-loop parameters to make this task learnable.
In Subsection 2.1, we did not specify the corruption that produces ˜xtfromxt. One design is to make
it a low-rank projection ˜xt=θKxt, whereθKis a learnable matrix.4Following the terminology of
multi-view reconstruction, θKxtis called a training view [14].
Moreover, perhaps not all the information in xtis worth remembering, so the reconstruction label
can be another low-rank projection θVxtinstead ofxt. HereθVxtis called the label view , whereθV
is also learnable. In summary, our new self-supervised loss is:
ℓ(W;xt) =f(θKxt;W)−θVxt2. (4)
Since bothWand various θs appear together in Equation 4, we emphasize again their di fference
in nature. In the inner loop, only Wis optimized, therefore written as an argument of ℓ; theθs
are "hyper-parameters" of this loss function. In the outer loop, θK,θV,θQare optimized alongside
θrest, andWis merely a hidden state, not a parameter. Figure 6 illustrates this di fference with code,
whereθKandθVare implemented as parameters of the TTT layer, analogous to the Key and Value
parameters of self-attention.
Lastly, the training view θKxthas fewer dimensions than xt, so we can no longer use the output rule
in Equation 1. The simplest solution is to create a test viewθQxt, and change our output rule to:
zt=f
θQxt;Wt
. (5)
This solution has an additional benefit. The training and label views specify the information in xt
that is compressed into Wtand propagated forward through time. The test view specifies potentially
different information that is mapped to the current output token ztand propagated forward through
network layers, therefore adds more flexibility to the self-supervised task.
Altogether, the set of all possible choices for θK,θQ,θVinduces a family of multi-view reconstruction
tasks, and the outer loop can be interpreted as selecting a task from this family. Here we have
designed all views as linear projections for simplicity. Future work might experiment with more
flexible transformations, or bigger and di fferent families of self-supervised tasks.
2.4 Parallelization with mini-batch TTT
The naive TTT layer developed so far is already e fficient in the number of floating point operations
(FLOPs). However, its update rule Wt=Wt−1−η∇l(Wt−1;xt)cannot be parallelized, because Wt
depends on Wt−1in two places: before the minus sign and inside ∇l. Since∇lcontains the bulk of
the computation, we focus on making this second part parallel.
We approach this systems challenge through concepts in the TTT framework. There are many
variants of gradient descent (GD). The general update rule of GD can be expressed as:
Wt=Wt−1−ηGt=W0−ηtX
s=1Gs, (6)
whereGtis the descent direction. Note that once we have calculated Gtfort= 1,...,T , we can then
obtain all the Wts through a cumsum by the second half of Equation 6. Our naive update rule, known
asonline gradient descent , usesGt=∇l(Wt−1;xt).
4The subscript Khints at a connection to self-attention, as we will establish in Subsection 2.6.

...Figure 7. High-level computation graph of the first TTT mini-batch, where nodes are variables and edges are
computations. The blue nodes are input variables, and yellow are output. Subsection 2.4 : SinceG1,...,Gb
are not connected, they have no sequential dependency on each other, therefore can be computed in parallel.
Subsection 2.5 : We do not actually materialize the white nodes – the intermediate Gs andWs – to compute the
output variables in the dual form.
To parallelize Gtfort= 1,...,T , we can take all of them w.r.t. W0. This variant with Gt=∇ℓ(W0;xt)
is known as batch gradient descent , sincePt
s=1∇ℓ(W0;xs)is the same as the gradient w.r.t. W0over
x1,...,xtas a batch. However, in batch GD, Wtis effectively only one gradient step away from W0,
in contrast to online GD, where Wtiststeps away from W0. Therefore, batch GD has a smaller
effective search space, which ends up hurting performance for language modeling.
Our proposed solution – mini-batch gradient descent – is shown in Figure 7. Denote the TTT batch size
byb. We useGt=∇ℓ(Wt′;xt), wheret′=t−mod(t,b)is the last timestep of the previous mini-batch
(or 0 for the first mini-batch), so we can parallelize bgradient computations at a time. Empirically,
bcontrols a trade-o ffbetween speed and quality, as shown in Figure 8. We chose b= 16 for all
experiments in this paper.
In summary, there are two potential channels to propagate information from WstoWtwheres<t:
cumsum and the gradient operator. The cumsum is always active, but the gradient channel is only
active when Wsis from a previous mini-batch. Di fferent variants of gradient descent only a ffect the
gradient channel, i.e., the descent direction Gt, specifically w.r.t. which Wthe gradient is taken.
However, the descent step Wt=Wt−1−ηGtalways starts from Wt−1, due to the autoregressive nature
of the update rule, which is orthogonal to the choice of Gt.
2.5 Dual form
The parallelization introduced above is necessary but not su fficient for e fficiency in wall-clock time.
Modern accelerators specialize in matrix-matrix multiplications, known as matmul s. For example,
the NVIDIA A100 GPU contains highly optimized units called TensorCores that can only perform a
single operation – multiplying two matrices each of size 16×16. Without enough of these matmul s,
the TensorCores are idle, and most of the potential for the A100 is unrealized.
Unfortunately, the TTT layer developed so far even with mini-batch still has very few matmul s.
Consider the simplest case of ℓ, whereθK=θV=θQ=I, for only the first TTT mini-batch of size b.
In addition, consider fas a linear model. Copying Equation 3, our loss at time tis:
ℓ(W0;xt)=∥f(xt;W0)−xt∥2=∥W0xt−xt∥2.
5In theory,bcan potentially be too small such that the variance between mini-batches is too high, hurting optimization.
However, we have not observed such an e ffect in practice.
6For Figure 8, we use a single TTT layer in TTT-Linear 1.3B, implemented in pure PyTorch. Our fused kernel significantly
improves time e fficiency, but makes it di fficult to cleanly decompose the time for computing Wbvs.z1,...,zb.

dual form, with context length T= 2048 . Total time (orange) can be decomposed into time for computing the
Ws at the end of every mini-batch (blue) and time for z1,...,zT(orange−blue).6Time complexity for the Ws
isO(T×d2), constant in b, but the blue line decreases as larger ballows more parallelization until hardware
utilization saturates. Time complexity for z1,...,zTisO(T×b×d), so the orange line first decreases with more
parallelization, then increases as the extra computation for z1,...,zTbecomes dominant.
As discussed in Subsection 2.4, we can parallelize the computation of:
Gt=∇ℓ(W0;xt)= 2(W0xt−xt)xT
t,
fort= 1,...,b . However, we cannot compute all bof theGts through a single matmul . Instead, we
needbouter products to compute them one by one. To make matters worse, for each xt∈Rd,Gtis
d×d, which incurs much heavier memory footprint and I/O cost than xtfor larged.
To solve these two problems, we make a simple observation: We do not actually need to materialize
G1,...,Gbas long as we can compute Wbat the end of the mini-batch, and the output tokens z1,...,zb
(see Figure 7). Now we demonstrate these computations with the simplified TTT-Linear case above.
DenoteX= [x1,...,xb], then:
Wb=W0−ηbX
t=1Gt=W0−2ηbX
t=1(W0xt−xt)xT
t=W0−2η(W0X−X)XT.
SoWbcan be conveniently computed with a matmul . To compute Z= [z1,...,zb], we know that:
zt=f(xt;Wt) =Wtxt=
W0−ηtX
s=1Gt

s=1(W0xs−xs)xT

Denoteδt=Pt
s=1(W0xs−xs)xTsxtand the matrix ∆= [δ1,...,δb]. We can derive that:
∆=(W0X−X)mask
XTX
, (8)
where mask is the upper triangular mask with zeros (similar to the attention mask, but with zeros
instead of infinities), and the term W0X−Xcan be reused from the computation of Wb. Now ∆is also
conveniently computed with matmul s. Plugging ∆back into Equation 7, we obtain Z=W0X−2η∆.
We call this procedure the dual form , in contrast to the primal form before this subsection, where
theGs andWs are explicitly materialized. As discussed, the two forms are equivalent in output.
The terminology of primal and dual follows prior work that has explored similar mathematical
formulations outside of TTT [ 36,8,59]. In Appendix A, we show that the dual form still works
whenfis a neural network with nonlinear layers, except with more complicated notation.

in this paper. The TTT layer with a linear model and batch GD is equivalent to linear attention [41].
Time complexity of the primal form within a TTT mini-batch is O(b×d2). Time complexity of the
dual form is O(b×d2)for computing Wbalone, then an additional O(b2×d)for computing z1,...,zb.
Compared to the primal, the dual form sacrifices theoretical complexity for hardware utilization. In
practice,dis typically a few hundred and bis chosen to be only 16. As a consequence, wall-clock
time for computing z1,...,zbis relatively small, as observed in the right panel of Figure 8. In our
JAX implementation, training with the dual form is more than 5 ×faster than with primal.
2.6 Theoretical equivalences
In Subsection 2.1, we mentioned that fcan be a linear model or a neural network. In Subsection 2.4,
we also discussed three variants of the update rule: online GD, batch GD, and mini-batch GD.
Each of these 2×3combinations induces a di fferent instantiation of the TTT layer, as illustrated in
Figure 9. We now show that among these induced instantiations, the TTT layer with a linear model
and batch GD is equivalent to linear attention [41], a widely known RNN layer.7

η= 1/2as the update rule, and W0= 0. Then, given the same input sequence x1,...,xT, the output rule
defined in Equation 5 produces the same output sequence z1,...,zTas linear attention.
Proof. By definition of ℓin Equation 4,∇ℓ(W0;xt)=−2(θVxt)(θKxt)T. By definition of batch GD in
Equation 6 :
Wt=Wt−1−η∇ℓ(W0;xt)=W0−ηtX
s=1∇ℓ(W0;xs)=tX
s=1(θVxs)(θKxs)T.
PluggingWtinto the output rule in Equation 5, we obtain the output token:
zt=f

=tX
s=1(θVxs)(θKxs)T(θQxt),
which is the definition of linear attention.
7In a nutshell, linear attention [ 41] is simply self-attention without the softmax. Recall the definition of self-attention:
zt=Vtsoftmax

RNN layersTTT layersSequencemodelinglayersw/ parametric learnersDetails inFigure9w/ nonparametric learners•Self-attention•…•Mamba•RWKV•LSTM•…Figure 10. RNN layers and TTT layers are
both subsets of sequence modeling layers.
RNN layers have a hidden state that is
fixed in size across time. TTT layers with
parametric learners are also RNN layers,
since their hidden state is also fixed in size.
TTT layers with nonparametric learners
can represent self-attention, as discussed
in Subsection 2.6.
In Table 1, we first empirically verify the equivalence above with an improved implementation of
linear attention.8Then, to illustrate the contribution of each of our components (including some
that will be introduced in the next subsection), we add them row by row to the TTT layer that is
equivalent to linear attention, and ultimately obtain our proposed instantiation called TTT-Linear .
The change from batch GD to mini-batch GD contributes the most improvement by a large margin.
While the space of models ×optimizers in Figure 9 is already large, machine learning is much richer
than optimizing the parameters Wtof a modelf. There are also nonparametric learners, such as
nearest neighbors, support vector machines (SVMs), and kernel ridge regression. By definition,
nonparametric learners do not have parameters Wt, and instead directly uses training data x1,...,xt.
Hence we use the notation f(x;x1,...,xt). We now show that for a particular nonparametric learner,
the induced TTT layer is equivalent to self-attention.
Theorem 2. Consider the TTT layer with the Nadaraya-Watson estimator [7, 12], defined as:
f(x;x1,...,xt) =1Pt
s=1κ(x,xs)tX
s=1κ(x,xs)ys, (9)
whereys=θVxsis the label view discussed in Subsection 2.3, and
κ
x,x′;θK,θQ
∝e(θKx)TθQx′(10)
is a kernel with bandwidth hyper-parameters θKandθQ. Then given the same input sequence x1,...,xT,
the output rule defined in Equation 5 produces the same output sequence z1,...,zTas self-attention.
Proof. Pluggingysandκabove into Equation 9 gives us the definition of self-attention.
Appendix B contains a detailed explanation of the Nadaraya-Watson estimator and kernel κabove.
In contrast to Theorem 1, Theorem 2 does not produce a di fferent implementation from attention.
For the TTT layer above, the hidden state is x1,...,xtor a similar list of processed training data, the
update rule adds xtto the list, and the output rule scans the list with κ. In previous subsections, our
hidden state has been defined as Wt, the update rule a gradient step, and the output rule a call to
f. To unify these two constructions, we define a new abstraction called a learner, which uniquely
induces a TTT layer.
Similar to its definition in standard machine learning packages [ 54], all learners need to implement
two methods: train and predict. Now we redefine the hidden state of the induced TTT layer as the
internal storage of the learner, and the update and output rules as the train and predict methods.
8The original formulation of linear attention in [ 41] contains a normalizer and a feature expansion on xt, which can still
be included in an equivalent TTT layer. However, prior work has found that these two additions can hurt performance [ 58],
which we have verified in our own experiment (first vs. second row of Table 1). Therefore, we only construct a TTT layer
equivalent to the simplest formulation of linear attention without the two additions.

in Subsection 2.6, learnable W0hurts slightly, but the

improvement comes from mini-batch TTT (changing
fromb=T= 2048 tob= 16 ). The second comes from
instantiating the inner model fwith LN and residual
connection. Both of these designs would be di fficult to
come across without the conceptual framework of TTT.
Under this new definition of TTT layers, both parametric learners such as that in Theorem 1 and
nonparametric learners such as that in Theorem 2 can be included. Figure 10 summarizes this
general definition of TTT layers in the broader scope of all sequence modeling layers.
This general definition has an additional benefit for parametric learners: There can be more objects
other thanWin the internal storage of parametric learners, such as the optimizer state, which will
also be included in the hidden state of the induced TTT layer. This extension allows TTT layers to
use more sophisticated optimizers such as Adam [42] in future work.
2.7 Implementation details
Instantiations of f.We propose two variants of TTT layers – TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, di ffering
only in their instantiations of f. For TTT-Linear, flin(x) =Wx, whereWis square. For TTT-MLP,
fMLPhas two layers similar to the MLPs in Transformers. Specifically, the hidden dimension is 4×
the input dimension, followed by a GELU activation [ 31]. For better stability during TTT, falways
contains a Layer Normalization (LN) and residual connection. That is, f(x) =x+LN(fres(x)),where
frescan beflinorfMLP.
LearnableW0.The TTT initialization W0is shared between all sequences, even though subsequent
weightsW1,...,WTare different for each input sequence. Instead of setting W0= 0, we can learn it
as part of the outer loop. Since outer-loop parameters are always denoted by θs instead of Ws, we
assign an alias θinit=W0. In practice, θinitadds a negligible amount of parameters comparing to the
reconstruction views θK,θQ,θV, because both its input and output are low dimensional. Empirically,
we observe that learning W0significantly improves training stability.
Learnableη.The learning rate is usually the most important hyper-parameter for gradient descent,
so we experiment with learning the inner-loop learning rate ηin Equation 6 as part of the outer loop.
We makeηa function of the input token (therefore di fferent across time) for additional flexibility.
Concretely, we design η(x) =ηbaseσ(θlr·x), where the learnable vector θlris an outer-loop parameter,
σis the sigmoid function, and the scalar ηbaseis the base learning rate, set to 1 for TTT-Linear and
0.1 for TTT-MLP . Alternatively, η(x) can also be interpreted as a gate for ∇ℓ.
Backbone architecture. The cleanest way to integrate any RNN layer into a larger architecture
would be to directly replace self-attention in a Transformer, known in this context as a backbone.
However, existing RNNs such as Mamba [ 26] and Gri ffin [18] all use a di fferent backbone from
Transformers. Most notably, their backbone contains temporal convolutions before the RNN layers,
which might help collect local information across time. After experimenting with the Mamba
backbone, we find that it also improves perplexity for TTT layers, so we incorporate it into our
proposed method. See Figure 16 (in Appendix) for details.

3 Experiments
We evaluate TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP by comparing with two baselines – Transformer and Mamba,
a modern RNN. Our main codebase is based on EasyLM [ 25], an open-source project for training
and serving LLMs in JAX. All experiments can be reproduced using the publicly available code and
datasets provided at the bottom of the first page.
Datasets. Following the Mamba paper [ 26], we perform standard experiments with 2k and 8k
context lengths on the Pile [ 24], a popular dataset of documents for training open-source LLMs [ 9].
However, the Pile contains few sequences of length greater than 8k [ 19]. To evaluate capabilities in
long context, we also experiment with context lengths ranging from 1k to 32k in 2×increments, on
a subset of the Pile called Books3, which has been widely used to train LLMs in long context [ 49,3].
Backbone architecture. As discussed in Subsection 2.7, Transformer and Mamba use di fferent
backbones, and TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP always use the Mamba backbone unless noted otherwise.
As an ablation study, Figure 11 and Figure 12 contain TTT layers within the Transformer backbone.
When a figure contains both the Transformer backbone and Mamba backbone, we denote them by
(T)and (M), respectively.
Protocols. To ensure fairness to our baselines, we strictly follow the evaluation protocols in the
Mamba paper when possible:
•For each evaluation setting (e.g., dataset, context length, and method), we experiment with four
model sizes: 125M, 350M, 760M, and 1.3B parameters. For Mamba, the corresponding sizes are
130M, 370M, 790M, and 1.4B, as Mamba does not follow the Transformer configurations.
•All models are trained with the Chinchilla recipe9described in the Mamba paper and reproduced
in our Appendix C. Our Transformer baseline, based on the Llama architecture [ 73], also follows
the baseline in the Mamba paper. As verification, our baselines can reproduce the numbers
reported in the Mamba paper in their evaluation settings.10
•We do not experiment with hybrid architectures (e.g. Gri ffin [18]), because our baselines are
not hybrid. While hybrid architectures that use both self-attention and TTT layers may improve
performance, they would reduce the clarity of our academic evaluation.
3.1 Short context: the Pile
From Figure 11, we make a few observations:
•At 2k context, TTT-Linear (M), Mamba, and Transformer have comparable performance, as the
lines mostly overlap. TTT-MLP (M) performs slightly worse under large FLOP budgets. Even
though TTT-MLP has better perplexity than TTT-Linear at every model size, the extra cost in
FLOPs o ffsets the advantage.
• At 8k context, both TTT-Linear (M) and TTT-MLP (M) perform significantly better than Mamba,
in contrast to the observation at 2k. Even TTT-MLP (T) with the Transformer backbone performs
slightly better than Mamba around 1.3B. A robust phenomenon we observe throughout this paper
is that as context length grows longer, the advantage of TTT layers over Mamba widens.
9The Chinchilla paper is another highly influential study of empirical scaling laws [ 34]. From large-scale experiments
with many hyper-parameters, they observe that the compute-optimal models follow a particular training recipe. We only
follow the Chinchilla recipe used in the Mamba paper, which may be slightly di fferent from the original recipe in [34].
10The only di fference between our protocol and that in the Mamba paper is the tokenizer. The Mamba paper uses two
different tokenizers – GPT-2 and GPT-NeoX – for various experiments. For consistency, we adhere to a single tokenizer
throughout this paper and choose the Llama tokenizer [73], which is the modern state-of-the-art.

comparable performance as Mamba at 2k context, and better performance at 8k.
•At 8k context, Transformer still has good (if not the best) perplexity at every model size, but its
line is not competitive because of the cost in FLOPs.
Effect of backbone. Switching the TTT layers from Mamba backbone into Transformer backbone
has two e ffects. First, TTT layers with Mamba backbone perform better in our evaluations so far.
Second, with Mamba backbone, TTT-MLP at best is only comparable to TTT-Linear; but with
Transformer backbone, TTT-MLP is clearly better. We hypothesize that the temporal convolutions in
the Mamba backbone help more when the sequence modeling layer has a less expressive hidden state.
The linear model is less expressive than the MLP, therefore benefits more from the convolutions.
We will revisit this hypothesis in the next subsection.
Lack of linear fit. The Chinchilla paper empirically observed that the compute-optimal models
following their recipe fall onto a line in the log-log plot of FLOPs vs. perplexity, as is often the
case for scaling law experiments [ 34]. However, we do not observe a clean linear fit in Figure 11 or
Figure 12 (the analogous experiments in Books), not even for Transformers. This is not surprising
given the di fferences in dataset, context length, tokenizer, and architecture. Following the Mamba
paper, we connect the points instead of fitting them with linear regression due to the large error.11
3.2 Long context: Books
To evaluate capabilities in long context, we experiment with context lengths ranging from 1k to 32k
in2×increments, using a popular subset of the Pile called Books3. The training recipe here is the
same as for the Pile, and all experiments for the TTT layers are performed in one training run.12
From the subset of results in Figure 12, we make a few observations:
•At 2k context on Books, all the observations from Pile 2k still hold, except that Mamba now
performs slightly better than TTT-Linear (whereas their lines roughly overlapped for Pile 2k).
11Ideally, we would have rerun all the hyper-parameters and derived a potentially new recipe for each method based on
our evaluation setting, following the process in the Chinchilla paper. If the new compute-optimal models do fall onto a line,
we could then predict performance beyond the current FLOPs regime [ 40,34]. However, this empirical study would require
orders of magnitude more resources than ours.
12Following the Mamba paper, we always use 0.5M tokens per training batch regardless of context length. That means
for context length Twe have 0.5M/Tsequences per batch (assume divisible).

for context lengths 1k, 2k, 4k, 8k, 16k, 32k, including Transformer finetuning, are in Figure 18 (in Appendix).
Most observations from the Pile still hold.
•At 32k context, both TTT-Linear (M) and TTT-MLP (M) perform better than Mamba, similar to the
observation from Pile 8k. Even TTT-MLP (T) with the Transformer backbone performs slightly
better than Mamba at 32k context.
•TTT-MLP (T) is only slightly worse than TTT-MLP (M) at 1.3B scale. As discussed, it is hard to
derive an empirical scaling law due to the lack of a clean linear fit. However, the strong trend for
TTT-MLP (T) suggests that the Transformer backbone might be more suitable for larger models
and longer context beyond our evaluations.
We only ablate the backbones for 2k and 32k due to the cost of training LLMs. For future work, we
believe that given TTT layers with even more expressive hidden states, the Mamba backbone with
temporal convolutions will become unnecessary.
Transformer finetuning. While we have been training Transformers from scratch following the
Mamba paper, in practice this approach is rarely used for long context. The standard practice is to
train a Transformer in short context, then finetune in long context. To reflect this practice, we add
another baseline, TF finetune , for context lengths 4k and above. This baseline starts from the model
trained (according to the Chinchilla recipe) on Books 2k, then uses 20% more tokens to finetune at
the designated context length, following the Llama Long paper [ 78]. See details of the TF finetune
recipe in Appendix C.
Our complete results for context lengths 1k, 2k, 4k, 8k, 16k, 32k, including TF finetune, are in
Figure 18 (in Appendix).
Context length as a hyper-parameter. While the length of the input sequence is determined by
the user, the context length at which the language model processes the input is determined by the
engineer as a design choice. Therefore, context length is a hyper-parameter that can be selected just
as other ones.13For LLMs with linear complexity, we select the argmin in perplexity, since every
context length has the same FLOPs. For Transformers, longer context costs more FLOPs, so we form
a convex hull of all the points in the log-log plot and connect those on the boundary.
13To be precise, there are two hyper-parameters: the context length at which the LLM is trained, and one at which the
LLM is evaluated. Both of them can be di fferent from the sequence length, which is determined by the user. Transformers
tend to perform poorly when the evaluation context is longer than the training context [ 18]. Therefore, we always evaluate at
the training context length, making the two hyper-parameters the same.

350M and 1.3B parameters, where Transformer isTF finetune , the stronger Transformer baseline.
From Figure 13, we make a few observations:
•The lines of TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, the best-performing methods, almost completely overlap.
The lines of Mamba and TF finetune also mostly overlap after 1020FLOPs.
•TF finetune performs significantly better than TF pretrain, as it benefits from long context without
incurring extremely large cost in training FLOPs. Note that the inference FLOPs of TF finetune
and pretrain are equally poor, which is not reflected in this plot.
•For all methods trained from scratch (including TF pretrain), perplexity becomes worse once the
context length becomes too large. This trend is highlighted in Figure 19 (in Appendix). We leave
further investigation of this trend to future work.
The left panel of Figure 2 is a zoomed-in view of Figure 13. For clarity, we leave TF pretrain out
of Figure 2 and only show TF finetune (labeled as Transformer ) since it is the stronger baseline.

linear model. Again, all methods have matched
training FLOPs as Mamba 1.4B. For TTT-Linear
and TTT-MLP, this protocol implies matched
inference FLOPs. Transformer (TF finetune) has
2.8×the inference FLOPs, giving it an advantage

but now with TTT-MLP . Note that our Transformer baseline is significantly faster then that in the Mamba paper,
because we use vLLM [ 46], a state-of-the-art serving system, instead of the HuggingFace Transformer [ 77].
Right : For generate (decode), TTT-Linear and Mamba have almost the same latency, which is significantly
smaller than that of Transformer and TTT-MLP .
3.3 Wall-clock time
LLM training and inference can be decomposed into forward, backward, and generate. Prompt
processing during inference, also known as prefill, is the same operation as forward during training,
except that the intermediate activations do not need to be stored for backward. Since both forward
(during training and inference) and backward can be parallelized, we use the dual form. Generating
new tokens, also known as decode, is inherently sequential, so we use the primal form.
Due to resource constraints, our experiments are written in JAX and run on TPUs. On a v5e-256 TPU
pod, the Transformer baseline takes 0.30s per iteration of training at context 2k, while TTT-Linear
takes 0.27s per iteration, already 10% faster without any systems optimization. However, Mamba
(implemented in PyTorch, Triton, and CUDA) can only run on GPUs, so for fair comparison, we also
rewrite our method with preliminary systems optimization to run on GPUs.
Specifically, we write a GPU kernel for forward in ThunderKittens [ 66]. Historically, RNNs have
been ine fficient during forward and backward due to poor use of parallelism and matmul s. Our goal
with the forward kernel is to demonstrate the e ffectiveness of mini-batch TTT and the dual form for
these problems. A kernel for backward should have the same properties in e fficiency as forward,
but requires more complex logic for manual di fferentiation, therefore is left for future work.
The left panel of Figure 15 shows the latency for batch size 16 of our forward kernel. All models
are 1.3B (1.4B for Mamba). Time per token grows linearly for Transformer as context length
increases, but stays roughly constant for the other methods.14Note that our Transformer baseline is
significantly faster that in the Mamba paper, because we use vLLM [ 46], a state-of-the-art serving
system, instead of the HuggingFace Transformer [77].
In addition, we write another GPU kernel for generate in Triton [ 72], and benchmark its speed
in the right panel of Figure 15 for batch size 512. Another popular metric for wall-clock time is
throughput, which takes into account the potential benefit of being able to use a larger batch size.15
For completeness, we report the throughput for forward and generate in Figure 20 (in Appendix).
All the observations and ordering between methods above still hold for throughput.
14We observe that forward latency of the network increases slightly for TTT-Linear, TTT-MLP, and Mamba, even though
latency of each sequence modeling layer alone stays constant. Consider the operation θX, whereθisd×dandXisd×T.
Its latency (normalized over T) is expected to be constant, but in practice grows slightly with T. One possible cause of this
phenomenon is the GPU throttling after Tgets very large [30].
15To calculate throughput for each method, we increase its batch size in 2×increments until GPU runs out of memory,
measure the tokens per second for every batch size, and select the highest.

4 Related Work
4.1 Modern RNNs
Mamba is one of the many Structured State-Space Models [ 27,21,57,18]. The hidden state in these
models is a vector, similar to in LSTMs. For TTT-Linear or TTT-MLP, the hidden state is a matrix
or two matrices, therefore larger. In Figure 14, we find that TTT layers can take advantage of their
larger hidden states to compress more information in long context, where TTT-MLP outperforms
TTT-Linear, which in turn outperforms Mamba.
Similar to TTT-Linear, RWKV [ 55,56], xLSTM [ 5], and Gated Linear Attention (GLA) [ 79] also
have matrix hidden states, which are inherited from linear attention [ 41]. Modern RNNs such as
GLA use chunk-wise parallelism to improve hardware e fficiency, so tokens inside a chunk can be
processed with matmul s instead of a cumsum . However, chunk-wise parallelism does not change the
expressiveness of the model, since all temporal dependencies are still equivalent to a cumsum .
In contrast, mini-batch TTT allows more complex temporal dependencies across mini-batches.
Each hidden state Wtdepends on previous Ws within its mini-batch still through a cumsum , but
depends on Ws in previous mini-batches also through the gradient operator. As illustrated Figure 8,
mini-batch TTT enables a trade-o ffbetween expressiveness and hardware e fficiency, since a smaller
batch sizebleads to better perplexity at the cost of higher latency. This trade-o ffis a unique and
important feature of TTT. As shown in Table 1, the intermediate batch size b= 16 significantly
outperforms b=Twhich is fully cumsum .
4.2 Learning at Test Time
The idea of learning at test time has a long history in machine learning. One of the earliest versions of
this idea is called local learning (Bottou and Vapnik [ 10]): For each test input, train on its neighbors
before making a prediction. This procedure has been e ffectively applied to models ranging from
SVMs [81] to modern LLMs [29].
Another early version of learning at test time is called transductive learning [22]. The principle of
transduction, as stated by Vladimir Vapnik [ 74], is to "... get the answer that you really need, but
not a more general one." Practical implementations of transductive learning use test data to add
constraints to the margin of SVMs [ 39,17]. However, transductive learning usually needs multiple
test instances to be empirically e ffective, unlike many instantiations of test-time training, which
only need a test single instance (image, video, or natural language sequence) at a time.
In computer vision, the idea of learning at test time has been applied for decades to applications such
as face detection [ 38], object detection [ 53], image super-resolution [ 65], and 3D reconstruction [ 50].
More recently, the same idea has also been applied to natural language processing, where it is called
dynamic evaluation [ 44,45]. The basic approach is to directly finetune a language model on the test
sequence, which often comes in the form of a prompt.
Next, we discuss two relevant lines of work in detail: test-time training and fast weights.
4.2.1 Test-Time Training
The core idea of Test-Time Training (TTT) is that each test instance defines its own learning problem,
where this test instance alone is the target of generalization [ 69]. Concretely, for each test instance x,
the conventional practice is to predict f(x), using a predictor fthat is optimized for all training
instances on average. TTT first formulates a learning problem defined by x, then trains a model fx
onx(often with fas initialization), and predicts fx(x).
18

Since the test instance comes without its label, the learning problem can only be formulated with a
self-supervised task. Prior work has shown that TTT with reconstruction significantly improves
performance especially on outliers [ 23]. Improvements become even more pronounced when testing
on video frames that arrive in a stream and TTT is autoregressive [ 76], asftis trained on past frames
x1,...,xt. The autoregressive connection makes [76] most relevant to our paper.
Conceptually, the biggest di fference between our paper and prior work is that our reconstruction
task is learned in an outer loop, instead of handcrafted with human priors. Follow-up work to TTT
has explored applications such as robot manipulation [ 28] and locomotion [ 68], among others, that
often require di fferent designs for the self-supervised task.
4.2.2 Fast Weights
The general idea of fast weights is to update the parameters of a “fast” model on only the most
relevant data, as opposed to the conventional practice of updating a “slow” model on all data [ 71].
This idea has existed since the 1980s [ 32]. The most relevant data can be the test instance itself,
therefore TTT can be viewed as a special case of fast weights.
Prior work in fast weights usually avoids forming an explicit learning problem that optimizes some
objective on data. For example, the update rule of Hebbian learning and Hopfield networks [ 35]
simply adds xxT(or some variant thereof) [ 4] to the fast weights given each input x. In contrast,
TTT embraces the idea of formulating an explicit learning problem, where the test instance is the
target of generalization. Our update rule is also an explicit step of optimization.
The idea of fast weight programmers (FWPs) is to update the fast weights with a “slow” model [ 62].
Our inner-loop weights Wcan be viewed as “fast” and outer-loop weights θas “slow”. Therefore,
networks containing TTT layers can be viewed as a special case of FWPs [ 43], similar to how TTT
can be viewed as a special case of fast weights. The FWP with the Hebbian update rule above is
equivalent to linear attention [60], therefore also to naive TTT-Linear with batch gradient descent.
The definition of FWPs is very broad. In fact, all networks with some gating mechanism, such as
Transformers with SwiGLU blocks [ 63], can also be viewed as a special case of FWPs16. Recent work
has been experimenting with FWPs for language modeling: Irie et al. [ 37] design “fast” networks
with weights produced as output of a “slow” networks. Clark et al. [ 16] give a Transformer a final
layer of fast weights, whose initialization is trained as slow weights. Our contribution relative to
existing work on FWPs, again, is formulating an explicit learning problem for the update, which
enables us to borrow tools from learning such as mini-batch and LN.
4.3 Learning to Learn
For decades, researchers have been arguing that learning to learn, also known as meta-learning or
bi-level optimization, should be a critical component of intelligence [ 61,6,70,47]. In prior work
such as [ 2], [20] and [ 52], the inner loop learns from an entire dataset at a time instead of a sequence,
so the outer loop needs a collection of datasets or tasks. In short, the outer loop is “one level above”
regular training. Since it is hard to collect millions of datasets, this outer loop is hard to scale.
In contrast, for TTT, each sequence itself is a dataset and defines its own generalization problem.
The inner loop is “one level below” regular training, so our outer loop is only another solution to
the canonical problem of supervised learning, instead of a new problem setting like generalization
across datasets. As illustrated in Table 2, our outer loop is “at the same level” as regular training.
This makes our outer loop easier to scale.
16Consider a simple gate z=σ(θx)⊙(θ′x), wherexis the input, zis the output, θandθ′are learnable weight matrices, ⊙
is element-wise multiplication, and σis the sigmoid function. A well known interpretation is to view W=diag (θ′x) as the
fast weights controlled by slow weights θ′, then equivalently, z=Wσ(θx)is simply a two-layer MLP with fast weights [ 26].

Table 2. In summary, our paper reformulates supervised learning as learning to learn, with two nested loops.
Highlighted rows of the outer loop are the same as in the regular training. Parameters of the outer loop become
hyper-parameters of the inner loop. Intuitively, the inner loop, i.e.TTT, is “one level below” regular training.
5 Discussion
We have reformulated the canonical problem of supervised learning as learning to (learn at test time).
Our formulation produces an alternative conceptual framework for building what is traditionally
known as network architectures. We summarize our current instantiation in Table 2.
The search space for e ffective instantiations inside this framework is huge, and our paper has only
taken a baby step. Fortunately, if our perspective holds, then heuristics from regular training can
transfer to test-time training, and search can be e fficient. Next we outline some especially promising
directions for future work.
•Outer-loop parameterization. There are many other ways to parameterize a family of multi-view
reconstruction tasks, or perhaps a more general family of self-supervised tasks. It would be a big
coincidence if the first one we have tried turns out to be the best.
•Systems optimization. Our systems optimization in Subsection 3.3 has been preliminary at best,
and there are many ways to improve it. In addition, pipeline parallelism through time might
allow us to process long sequences of millions of tokens on multiple devices together.
•Longer context and larger models. Constrained by our academic resources, we have not trained
with millions or billions in context length, which would also require larger models according to
Figure 19. The advantage of TTT layers should become more pronounced in longer context.
•More ambitious instantiations of f.When context length becomes longer, fwould also need
to be larger. For video tasks and embodied agents, whose context length can easily scale up to
millions or billions, fcould be a convolutional neural network.
•Multi-level learning to learn. Iffitself is a self-attention layer, then by Theorem 2 it can be
interpreted as yet another inner loop nested inside the existing one. In this fashion, we can
potentially build many levels of nested learning problems.
Why do we study TTT? First a more basic question: Why study AI? For some of us, AI is a playground
to probe about the nature of human intelligence. Prior work often tries to model human learning
with machine learning, where training is on a shu ffled dataset with i.i.d. instances, and inference
is on a separate test set. However, humans do not naturally learn with i.i.d. instances or have a
train-test split. We believe that human learning has a more promising connection with TTT, our
inner loop, whose data is a potentially very long sequence with strong temporal dependencies, and
any piece of data can be used for both training and testing. This is why we study TTT.

A Dual Form
The goal of this section is to derive the dual form for general MLPs of arbitrary depth, with nonlinear
activations.
Without loss of generality, consider η= 1for convenience, and consider only the first mini-batch,
wheret= 1,...,b . Denote:ˆxt=θKxt, yt=θVxt,¯xt=θQxt.
Also denote ˆX= [ˆx1,..., ˆxb], andYand ¯Xanalogously. In general, uppercase letters denote matrices
whose columns are vectors denoted by the corresponding lowercase letter.
For a network with Klayers, denote the initial parameters in layer kbyWk
0. Our convention is to
use superscripts for the layer and subscripts for time.
A.1 Forward pass
During the initial forward pass of TTT, we denote the input to layer kbyˆXk= [ˆxk
1,..., ˆxk
b], with
ˆX1=ˆX. Now we write the forward pass of TTT using these notations.
Fork= 1,...,K :
•Zk=Wk
0ˆXk
•ˆXk+1=σk(Zk)
whereσkfork= 1,...,K can be any element-wise operation ( R7→R) with derivative σ′.
Given ˆXK+1, we compute the loss:

All the operations above (except σ) are matmul s and sums, therefore are hardware e fficient. Both the
primal form and the dual form share these initial operations.
A.2 Primal form
The primal form first computes Gk
t=∇Wk
0ltfort= 1,...,b , then updates Wk
t=Wk
0−Pt
s=1Gks. Finally,
given ¯X1= [¯x1
1,..., ¯x1
b] =¯X, the primal form repeats the forward pass with the updated Ws.
Fork= 1,...,K :
•¯zk
t=Wk
t¯xk
t, fort= 1,...,T
•¯xk+1
t=σk(¯zk
t), fort= 1,...,T
where ¯XK+1= [¯xk+1
1,..., ¯xk+1
b] contains the output tokens.
Note that a standard backward pass only computes the sum of the gradients:
∇Wk
0l=bX
t=1∇Wk
0lt=bX
t=1Gk
t,
so the computation of the individual terms in the sum Gk
tfort= 1,...,b cannot be batched together
into matmul s. Similarly, the forward pass in primal form uses a di fferentWtfor each ¯xt, therefore
27

also cannot be batched in the same way as a standard forward pass. These non-standard passes have
poor hardware e fficiency.
A.3 Dual form
As discussed in Subsection 2.5, the goal of the dual form is to compute ¯XK+1andW1
b,...,WK
bwith
only matmul s and light-weight operations such as sums,σ, andσ′. To achieve this goal, we avoid
explicitly computing the intermediate variables: Gk
tandWk
tfort= 1,...,b .
The dual form first computes ∇ˆXK+1l=ˆXK+1−Y, then takes a standard backward pass.
Fork=K,..., 1:
•∇Zkl=σ′
k(∇ˆXk+1l)
•∇ˆXkl=
Wk
0T∇Zkl
•∇Wk
0l=∇ZklˆXkT
Now we can already compute Wk
b=Wk
0−∇Wk
0l. To compute the output tokens, we do another
forward pass.
Fork= 1,...,K :
•¯Zk=Wk¯Xk−∇Zkl·maskˆXkT¯Xk
•¯Xk+1=σ(¯Zk)
By the end of the forward pass, we have computed ¯XK+1.
While this forward pass is non-standard, it only contains matmul s,sums,σ, and mask , therefore is
efficient like the standard forward pass.
A.4 Derivation
To derive the dual form, we show that:
¯Zk=Wk¯Xk−∇Zkl·maskˆXkT¯Xk
is the same as what would be computed in the primal form. Specifically, we show that each column
¯zk
tof¯Zkin the forward pass of the dual equals to Wk
t¯xk
tin the forward pass of the primal. We invoke
a simple fact.
Fact 1. Define matrices A= [a1,...,ab],Q= [q1,...,qb], andV= [v1,...,vb].17Define ˆvt=Pt
s=1aTsqtvs,
and ˆV= [ˆv1,..., ˆvb], then ˆV=V·mask (ATQ).
Now plugA=ˆXk,Q=¯Xk,V=∇Zkl, and ˆV=Wk¯Xk−¯Zkinto the fact above, we have shown the
desired equality.
Note that the σkandσ′
kused above can be extended to arbitrary functions that are not necessarily
element-wise operations, including normalization layers. This extension can be achieved through,
for example, vjp(vector-Jacobian product) in standard libraries for automatic di fferentiation such
as JAX and PyTorch. However, the dual form cannot accelerate operations inside σor its vjp.

B Nadaraya-Watson estimator
Derivation for the Nadaraya-Watson estimator. Throughout this section, we use xto denote the
input token xas a random variable. Our desired output is the corresponding output token, another
random variable z. This is formulated as estimating the conditional expectation of z:
E[z|x=x] =Z
p(z|x)zdz =Zp(x,z)
p(x)zdz.
Since the true probability distributions p(x)andp(x,z)are unknown, we replace them with their
kernel density estimations. Specifically, the kernel density estimation for p(x) is:
ˆp(x) =1
nnX
i=1κ(x,xi),
where each xiis a piece of training data in general. (Recall that for our paper, xiis specifically
training data for the inner loop, i.e.a token, which matches our notation in the main text.)
For estimating p(x,y), we use the product kernel:
ˆp(x,z) =1
nnX
i=1κ(x,xi)κ′(z,zi).
At first sight, it seems absurd to factor the joint probability into two seemingly independent kernels.
But in this case, κ′can actually be any κ′
idependent on xi, since it will be integrated out. So the two
kernels do not need to be independent.
Plugging in those estimations, we obtain the Nadaraya-Watson estimator:
ˆE[z|x=x] =Zˆp(x,z)
ˆp(x)zdz
=1
ˆp(x)Z
ˆp(x,z)zdz
=1Pn
i=1κ(x,xi)ZnX
i=1κ(x,xi)κ′(z,zi)zdz
=1Pn
i=1κ(x,xi)nX
i=1κ(x,xi)Z
κ′(z,zi)zdz
=1Pn
i=1κ(x,xi)nX
i=1κ(x,xi)zi.
Asymmetric kernels. In modern days, people think of kernels as positive semi-definite, which
might not be guaranteed for κunlessθK=θQ. However, people working on kernels decades ago,
around the time when the Nadaraya-Watson estimator was popular, have been very lenient with
the choice of kernels, and asymmetric kernels such as our κin Equation 10 have enjoyed a long
tradition: When a kernel estimator uses θK,θQ, it is known as a balloon estimator [ 15]. Papers such
as Breiman et al. [11] have even used θQas a function of x′, known as sample-adaptive smoothing.

To accommodate the extra parameters of the gate without changing the embedding dimension, we simply
combineθKandθQinto a single projection.
C Experiment details
Architectures. Our Transformer strictly follows the construction in the Mamba paper, where
Transformer is called Transformer++ . Specifically, the Transformer architecture is based on Llama [ 73],
with rotary positional encodings (RoPE) [ 67], SwiGLU MLP blocks [ 63], and RMSNorm [ 80] instead
of LayerNorm. Our Mamba baseline uses the public code provided by the authors. We have verified
that our baselines can reproduce the numbers reported in [26].
Training configurations. Our training configurations are in Table 3, which simply reproduces
Table 12 in the Mamba paper. As discussed in Footnote 12, all models are trained with a batch size
of 0.5M tokens regardless of context length. All of our optimization hyper-parameters follow the
“improved recipe" in Appendix E.2 of the Mamba paper, reproduced below:
• AdamW optimizer: β= (0.9,0.95)
• Cosine schedule: decay to end learning rate 1 e−5
• Linear learning rate warmup over 10% of the training steps
• Weight decay: 0.1
• Gradient clipping: 1.0
• No Dropout
• Mixed Precision

Table 3. Training configurations for all experiments. This table reproduces Table 12 in the Mamba paper.
The only di fference is that the learning rate they use for Mamba and Transformer is 5×the values in their
Table 12, and we report the actual values (5 ×). Note that this table only applies to TTT-Linear, TTT-MLP, and
Transformers, as Mamba does not follow the multi-head residual block structure inherited from Transformers.
As discussed in Footnote 10, all models are trained using the Llama tokenizer [ 73]. For experiments
on the Pile, this is the only di fference with the recipe in the Mamba paper, which uses two other
tokenizers. For experiments on Books, we find that the original angle of the RoPE encoding [ 67]
θ= 10,000is sub-optimal for our Transformer baseline in long context. Starting at context length
4k, we tryθ= 500,000 following the Llama Long paper [ 78], and use the better perplexity for
Transformer (both pretrain and finetune).
Transformer finetuning. Finetuning starts a new cosine schedule with the same optimization
hyper-parameter as training from scratch, except the peak learning rate. We try three peak learning
rates for finetuning: 1e-5, 1e-4, and 1e-3, and select for the best perplexity. We observe that 1e-4
works the best for the 125M models, while 1e-5 works the best for 350M and larger. This observation
is reasonable considering that the end learning rate for the Chinchilla recipe is 1e-5.
Learning rate for TTT. As mentioned in Subsection 2.7, the inner-loop base learning rate ηbaseis
set to 1 for TTT-Linear and 0.1 for TTT-MLP . Our heuristic for setting ηbaseis similar to how people
set the outer-loop learning rate for regular training: We tried ηbase∈{0.01,0.1,1,10}and used the
largest value that does not cause instabilities. For TTT-MLP, we use linear warmup for ηbaseover
10% of the training steps, similar to regular training. The number of training steps in the inner loop
isT/b(assume divisible). For TTT-Linear, we tried linear warmup in the inner loop but did not
observe a di fference.
Experiments in Figure 2 (right) and Figure 14. To ensure fairness to Mamba, all methods in
these experiments have matched training FLOPs and are trained with the same recipe (last row of
Table 3) as Mamba 1.4B. To match FLOPs with Mamba, Transformer has 19 blocks instead of 24.
For TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, their FLOPs are already close to those of Mamba, so we change the
hidden dimension of the MLP blocks from 5504 to 5808 (TTT-Linear) and 5248 (TTT-MLP).
Gradient checkpointing through time. By default, libraries such as JAX and PyTorch save the
intermediate activations during a forward pass so they can be reused during the backward pass.
However, for a TTT layer with Was hidden state, this default saves W1,...,WT, which uses too much
memory. With TTT mini-batch and the dual form, we still need to save (assume divisible) κ=T/b
Ws at the end of the mini-batches. A standard technique to save memory in this scenario is gradient
checkpointing [13], which is usually applied through layers, but we apply it through time.
